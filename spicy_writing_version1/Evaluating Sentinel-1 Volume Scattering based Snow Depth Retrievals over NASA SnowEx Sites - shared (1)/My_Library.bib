abstract = {{Porous materials are common on the Earth's surface and in the crust. Accordingly, their physical properties have received a lot of attention. A century ago, Maxwell and Rayleigh each modeled the physical properties of aggregate materials as discrete spheres embedded in continuous matrices. Although the particles of interest in snow are not spheres and do have interconnections, these basic models give first‐order predictions of the thermal conductivity. In the last 3 decades, scientists have attempted to make the predictions more precise by determining the effect of geometry on heat and mass flow using basic physical models and data collected from images of planar sections of aggregates. Under favorable circumstances, physical parameters and quantitative microscopic parameters of an aggregate may be highly correlated, but physical understandings of the geometric effects are not likely to arise from such studies until physical models can be based on measurable fundamental parameters. In snow, as in other aggregates, that goal seems to be a long way from realization.}},

abstract = {{Airborne photogrammetry is undergoing a renaissance: lower-cost equipment, more powerful software, and simplified methods have significantly lowered the barriers to entry and now allow repeat mapping of cryospheric dynamics at spatial resolutions and temporal frequencies that were previously too expensive to consider. Here we apply these advancements to the measurement of snow depth from manned aircraft. Our main airborne hardware consists of a consumer-grade digital camera directly coupled to a dual-frequency GPS; no inertial motion unit (IMU) or on-board computer is required, such that system hardware and software costs less than USD 30 000, exclusive of aircraft. The photogrammetric processing is done using a commercially available implementation of the structure from motion (SfM) algorithm. The system is simple enough that it can be operated by the pilot without additional assistance and the technique creates directly georeferenced maps without ground control, further reducing overall costs. To map snow depth, we made digital elevation models (DEMs) during snow-free and snow-covered conditions, then subtracted these to create difference DEMs (dDEMs). We assessed the accuracy (real-world geolocation) and precision (repeatability) of our DEMs through comparisons to ground control points and to time series of our own DEMs. We validated these assessments through comparisons to DEMs made by airborne lidar and by a similar photogrammetric system. We empirically determined that our DEMs have a geolocation accuracy of ±30 cm and a repeatability of ±8 cm (both 95 \% confidence). We then validated our dDEMs against more than 6000 hand-probed snow depth measurements at 3 separate test areas in Alaska covering a wide-variety of terrain and snow types. These areas ranged from 5 to 40 km2 and had ground sample distances of 6 to 20 cm. We found that depths produced from the dDEMs matched probe depths with a 10 cm standard deviation, and were statistically identical at 95 \% confidence. Due to the precision of this technique, other real changes on the ground such as frost heave, vegetative compaction by snow, and even footprints become sources of error in the measurement of thin snow packs (}},

In this study we demonstrate first results of wet snow depth estimation by differencing sp-InSAR DEMs acquired by the TanDEM-X satellite mission. The results show, in contrast to dry snow, a clear sensitivity to wet snow.

The flow decreases as ice-layer thickness increases and, in general, flow changes with permeability. However, the magnitude of the effect is proportionately weaker when the ice layers are further from the surface. The residence time is reduced when hoar layers are present due to shorter flow paths, reduced penetration into the deeper snow and higher speeds.}},

First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed "DeepLab" system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7\% mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes.

Point snow data are used to generate or improve (i.e., blend with) gridded estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) by using various forms of interpolation; however, the interpolation methodologies often overlook the physical mechanisms for the snow being there in the first place. Using data from the Snow Telemetry and Cooperative Observer networks in the western United States, we show that four methods for the spatial interpolation of peak of winter snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow depth based on distance and elevation can result in large errors. These errors are reduced substantially by our new method, i.e., the spatial interpolation of these quantities normalized by accumulated snowfall from the current or previous water years. Our method results in significant improvement in SWE estimates over interpolation techniques that do not consider snowfall, regardless of the number of stations used for the interpolation. Furthermore, it can be used along with gridded precipitation and temperature data to produce daily maps of SWE over the western United States that are comparable to existing estimates (which are based on the assimilation of much more data). Our results also show that not honoring the constraint between SWE and snowfall when blending in situ data with gridded data can lead to the development and propagation of unrealistic errors. Accumulated snowfall is a strong predictor of peak SWE and snow depth at SNOTEL and COOP sites For this data, spatial interpolation of SWE is improved by first normalizing by accumulated snowfall This interpolation produces maps of SWE comparable to existing maps that are based on much more data}},

Performing the classification requires global datasets of air temperature, precipitation, and land-cover. When introduced in 1995, the finest resolution global datasets of these variables were on a 0.5° × 0.5° latitude-longitude grid (approximately 50 km). Here we revisit the snow classification system and, using new datasets and methods, present a revised classification on a 10-arcsecond × 10-arcsecond latitude-longitude grid (approximately 300 m). We downscaled 0.1° × 0.1° latitude-longitude (approximately 10 km) gridded meteorological climatologies (1981-2019, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts [ECMWF] ReAnalysis, 5 th Generation Land [ERA5-Land]) using MicroMet, a spatially distributed, high-resolution, micro-meteorological model. The resulting air temperature and precipitation datasets were combined with European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) GlobCover land-cover data (as a surrogate for wind speed) to produce the updated classification, which we have applied to all of Earth’s terrestrial areas. We describe this new, high-resolution snow classification dataset, highlight the improvements added to the classification system since its inception, and discuss the utility of the climatological snow classes at this much higher resolution. The snow class dataset (Global Seasonal-Snow Classification 2.0) and the tools used to develop the data are publicly available online at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).}}

However, thermal conductivities measured with the transient needle probe and the steady-state, heat flux plate differ. In addition, the anisotropy of thermal conductivity plays an important role in the accuracy of thermal conductivity measurements. In this study, we investigated three independent methods to measure snow thermal conductivity and its anisotropy: a needle probe with a long heating time, a guarded heat flux plate, and direct numerical simulation at the microstructural level of the pore and ice structure. The three methods were applied to identical snow samples. We analyzed the consistency and the difference between these methods. As already shown in former studies, we observed a distinct difference between the anisotropy of thermal conductivity in small rounded grains and in depth hoar. Indeed, the anisotropy between vertical and horizontal thermal conductivity components ranges between 0.5–2. This can cause a difference in thermal conductivity measurements carried out with needle probes of up to –25 \% to +25 \% if the thermal conductivity is calculated only from a horizontally inserted needle probe. Based on our measurements and the comparison of the three methods studied here, the direct numerical simulation is the most reliable method, as the tensorial components of the thermal conductivity can be calculated and the corresponding microstructure is precisely known.}},

abstract = {{Two common refrains about using the one‐dimensional advection diffusion equation to estimate fluid fluxes and thermal conductivity from temperature time series in streambeds are that the solution assumes that (1) the surface boundary condition is a sine wave or nearly so, and (2) there is no gradient in mean temperature with depth. Although the mathematical posing of the problem in the original solution to the problem might lead one to believe these constraints exist, the perception that they are a source of error is a fallacy. Here we develop a mathematical proof demonstrating the equivalence of the solution as developed based on an arbitrary (Fourier integral) surface temperature forcing when evaluated at a single given frequency versus that derived considering a single frequency from the beginning. The implication is that any single frequency can be used in the frequency‐domain solutions to estimate thermal diffusivity and 1‐D fluid flux in streambeds, even if the forcing has multiple frequencies. This means that diurnal variations with asymmetric shapes or gradients in the mean temperature with depth are not actually assumptions, and deviations from them should not cause errors in estimates. Given this clarification, we further explore the potential for using information at multiple frequencies to augment the information derived from time series of temperature. Measuring temperature over time at different depths in streambeds has become a common practice for estimating infiltration into streambeds or upwelling water rates. These values are important for fish eggs, stream‐bottom insects, filtering of pollutants in streams, and managing water resources. It has often been assumed that real‐life temperature fluctuations, which are a bit noisy and only look approximately like sine waves, caused errors in these calculations. It was also thought that a warm stream flowing above cold groundwater (another common situation) could cause errors. The mathematical derivations in this paper and accompanying laboratory work show that neither of these assumed sources of error actually cause errors. This is good news, as it crosses two suspects off the list when we try to trace errors, and we can turn our attention toward more serious issues when thinking about how to improve these calculations. “Perfect” sine waves and zero gradient in mean temperature are not assumptions of temperature‐tracer methods to estimate streambed fluxes The amplitude‐phase solution can be used with one or multiple frequencies when using the Fourier transform Only a single frequency is needed to solve for and but use of other frequencies is possible as well}},

We find that both theoretical predictions underestimate high-frequency perturbation pressure attenuation with depth in the near-surface snowpack and the discrepancy between theory and measurement increases with perturbation pressure frequency. The impact of this result for near-surface snow is that potential enhanced sublimation will occur over a shallower snow depth than these two theories predict. Correspondingly, interstitial air mixing at depth in firn will be driven by lower frequencies than these two theories predict. While direct measurement of these energy-rich lower frequencies is beyond the scope of this paper, stationary pressure measurements validate the presence of a pressure field that could drive near-surface circulation.}},

abstract = {{All currently available climate models predict a near-surface warming trend under the influence of rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In addition to the direct effects on climate—for example, on the frequency of heatwaves—this increase in surface temperatures has important consequences for the hydrological cycle, particularly in regions where water supply is currently dominated by melting snow or ice. In a warmer world, less winter precipitation falls as snow and the melting of winter snow occurs earlier in spring. Even without any changes in precipitation intensity, both of these effects lead to a shift in peak river runoff to winter and early spring, away from summer and autumn when demand is highest. Where storage capacities are not sufficient, much of the winter runoff will immediately be lost to the oceans. With more than one-sixth of the Earth's population relying on glaciers and seasonal snow packs for their water supply, the consequences of these hydrological changes for future water availability—predicted with high confidence and already diagnosed in some regions—are likely to be severe. Health warningNature this week includes reviews, original research and comment on a hot topic, the regional effects of climate change. The cover image — Chicago during the July 1995 heatwave — highlights one potential risk. Patz et al. consider the available evidence and suggest that climate warming already contributes to ill health and thousands of premature deaths across the world, and is likely to have serious health implications in the future. Recent work suggests that some regions are particularly at risk: areas where climate is dominated by El Niño/Southern Oscillation events, sub-Saharan Africa, and sprawling urban areas subject to the heat island effect are already suffering from climate impacts and these are projected to increase. In many cases, regions at high risk are those least responsible for causing climate change. Sure thing All currently available climate models predict a near-surface warming trend under the influence of rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Barnett et al. evaluate the effect of such a warming trend on regional hydrology, particularly in snowmelt-dominated environments. They suggest that warming will cause a change from snowfall to rain, diminishing natural water storage capacity, as well as earlier melting of winter snow, shifting peak river runoff away from the periods of highest demand in summer and autumn. The reduction in glaciers and snow-packs are likely to have severe consequences for the water supply of one-sixth of the Earth's population. Water supply It is generally assumed that climate change will alter the hydrological cycle, but predicting which parts of the world will be drier and which will be wetter is a difficult problem. Milly et al. focus on streamflow and water availability trends and find that an ensemble of twelve current climate models accurately accounts for twentieth-century changes. The same models project potentially crucial regional effects on streamflow in the future that could threaten the availability of freshwater in many regions of the world by the year 2050.}},

Measuring SWE takes ∼20 times as long as measuring depth, which in part is why depth measurements outnumber SWE measurements worldwide.

The method is grounded in the fact that depth varies over a range that is many times greater than that of bulk density. Consequently, estimates derived from measured depths and modeled densities generally fall close to measured values of SWE. Knowledge of snow climate classes is used to improve the accuracy of the estimation procedure. A statistical model based on a Bayesian analysis of a set of 25 688 depth–density–SWE data collected in the United States, Canada, and Switzerland takes snow depth, day of the year, and the climate class of snow at a selected location from which it produces a local bulk density estimate.

The temporal evolution of snow wetness’s plays a significant role in wet-snow avalanche prediction, meltwater release, and water availability estimations and assessments within a river basin. However, it remains a difficult task and a demanding issue to measure the snowpack’s liquid water content (LWC) and its temporal evolution with conventional in situ techniques. We propose an approach based on the use of time-domain reflectometry (TDR) and CS650 soil water content reflectometers to measure the snowpack’s LWC and temperature profiles. For this purpose, we created an easily-applicable, low-cost, automated, and continuous LWC profiling instrument using reflectometers at the Cooperative Remote Sensing Science and Technology Center-Snow Analysis and Field Experiment (CREST-SAFE) in Caribou, ME, USA, and tested it during the snow melt period (February–April) immediately after installation in 2014. Snow Thermal Model (SNTHERM) LWC simulations forced with CREST-SAFE meteorological data were used to evaluate the accuracy of the instrument. Results showed overall good agreement, but clearly indicated inaccuracy under wet snow conditions. For this reason, we present two (for dry and wet snow) statistical relationships between snow LWC and dielectric permittivity similar to Topp’s equation for the LWC of mineral soils. These equations were validated using CREST-SAFE in situ data from winter 2015. Results displayed high agreement when compared to LWC estimates obtained using empirical formulas developed in previous studies, and minor improvement over wet snow LWC estimates. Additionally, the equations seemed to be able to capture the snowpack state (i.e., onset of melt, medium, and maximum saturation). Lastly, field test results show advantages, such as: automated, continuous measurements, the temperature profiling of the snowpack, and the possible categorization of its state. However, future work should focus on improving the instrument’s capability to measure the snowpack’s LWC profile by properly calibrating it with in situ LWC measurements. Acceptable validation agreement indicates that the developed snow LWC, temperature, and wetness profiler offers a promising new tool for snow hydrology research.}},

Here constant properties for ice and air, and empirical relationships are used to estimate unknown porous properties from snow porosity. Using this set of equations, phase velocities and plane wave attenuation of shear- and compressional waves are predicted as functions of porosity or density. For light snow the peculiarity was found that the velocity of the first compressional wave is lower than that of the second compressional wave that is commonly referred to as the ‘slow’ wave. The reversal of the velocities comes with an increase of attenuation for the first compressional wave. This is in line with the common observation that sound is strongly absorbed in light snow. The results have important implications for the use of acoustic waves to evaluate snow properties and to numerically simulate wave propagation in snow.}},

A well-documented shift toward earlier runoff in recent decades has been attributed to 1) more precipitation falling as rain instead of snow and 2) earlier snowmelt. The present study addresses the former, documenting a regional trend toward smaller ratios of winter-total snowfall water equivalent (SFE) to winter-total precipitation (P) during the period 1949–2004. The trends toward reduced SFE are a response to warming across the region, with the most significant reductions occurring where winter wet-day minimum temperatures, averaged over the study period, were warmer than −5°C. Most SFE reductions were associated with winter wet-day temperature increases between 0° and +3°C over the study period. Warmings larger than this occurred mainly at sites where the mean temperatures were cool enough that the precipitation form was less susceptible to warming trends. The trends toward reduced SFE/P ratios were most pronounced in March regionwide and in January near the West Coast, corresponding to widespread warming in these months. While mean temperatures in March were sufficiently high to allow the warming trend to produce SFE/P declines across the study region, mean January temperatures were cooler, with the result that January SFE/P impacts were restricted to the lower elevations near the West Coast. Extending the analysis back to 1920 shows that although the trends presented here may be partially attributable to interdecadal climate variability associated with the Pacific decadal oscillation, they also appear to result from still longer-term climate shifts.}},

Manual corrections hamper regular updates. In this study, we present an automatic approach to delineate glacier outlines using interferometrically derived synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence, slope and morphological operations. InSAR coherence detects the temporally decorrelated surface (e.g. glacial extent) irrespective of its surface type and separates it from the highly coherent surrounding areas. We tested the impact of different processing settings, for example resolution, coherence window size and topographic phase removal, on the quality of the generated outlines. We found minor influence of the topographic phase, but a combination of strong multi-looking during interferogram generation and additional averaging during coherence estimation strongly deteriorated the coherence at the glacier edges. We analysed the performance of X-, C- and L- band radar data. The C-band Sentinel-1 data outlined the glacier boundary with the least misclassifications and a type II error of 0.47\% compared with Global Land Ice Measurements from Space inventory data. Our study shows the potential of the Sentinel-1 mission together with our automatic processing chain to provide regular updates for land-terminating glaciers on a large scale.}},

While the phase record of the signal identified with the soil return showed almost no variation, in stark contrast, the phase from the buried target showed a strongly linear change with time. A model is presented, which describes the observed phase changes in terms of retardation of the signal by the soil dielectric properties, which are dependent upon the moisture content. The model confirms a strongly linear relationship between phase and volumetric soil moisture. The linearity promises to greatly simplify any exploitation scheme, and such a DInSAR scheme would be applicable at large standoff distances from airborne and spaceborne platforms, in contrast to current subsurface techniques which rely on close-in measurement to spatially isolate returns vertically in backscatter.}},

Array processing using cross‐correlation lag times and semblance places constraints on the lahar's dynamics, including detection of an initial flow pulse that traveled from 2 to 12 km at an average speed of 38 m/s. Subsequently, the lahar signal evolved to a relatively stationary infrasonic tremor located 10 to 12 km from the vent and adjacent to a topographic notch, through which sound may have preferentially diffracted toward the recording site. This study demonstrates the powerful capabilities of infrasound arrays for lahar study and suggests their potential application for future hazard monitoring.

In recent years, technological and signal processing advances have led to the development of operational infrasound avalanche detection systems. We evaluated the detection performance of four operationally running infrasound detection systems installed at three different sites in the Swiss Alps during two entire winter seasons. To this end, we collected a comprehensive data set of avalanche activity using a network of automatic cameras and supplementary field observations by local observers. The events automatically identified by the systems were then compared to the data set of visually observed avalanches. Only 3\% of the 839 observed avalanches were associated with automatic detections and 21\% of the automatic detections were confirmed by field observations. However, the majority of observed avalanches were small and most automatic detections occurred during periods of poor visibility. Furthermore, the probability of detection (POD) increased with avalanche size, decreased with distance, and varied with avalanche type. Dry-snow avalanches were generally better detected than wet-snow and mixed-type avalanches. Large avalanches (on the order of 300 m wide and 1000 m long) within a distance of 3 km from the array were typically well detected (POD ≈ 90\%). The false alarm ratio was estimated to 13–30\%.}},

Therefore, it is desirable to additionally learn corrections from a limited number of example repairs. To effectively generalize example repairs, it is necessary to capture the entire context of each erroneous value. A context comprises the value itself, the co-occurring values inside the same tuple, and all values that define the attribute type. Typically, an error corrector based on any of these context information undergoes an individual process of operations that is not always easy to integrate with other types of error correctors. In this paper, we present a new error correction system, Baran, which provides a unifying abstraction for integrating multiple error corrector models that can be pretrained and updated in the same way. Because of the holistic nature of our approach, we generate more correction candidates than state of the art and, because of the underlying context-aware data representation, we achieve high precision. We show that, by pretraining our models based on Wikipedia revisions, our system can further improve its overall precision and recall. In our experiments, Baran significantly outperforms state-of-the-art error correction systems in terms of effectiveness and human involvement requiring only 20 labeled tuples.}},

abstract = {{Pacific walruses (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) are using coastal haulouts in the Chukchi Sea more often and in larger numbers to rest between foraging bouts in late summer and autumn in recent years, because climate warming has reduced availability of sea ice that historically had provided resting platforms near their preferred benthic feeding grounds. With greater numbers of walruses hauling out in large aggregations, new opportunities are presented for monitoring the population. Here we evaluate different types of satellite imagery for detecting and delineating the peripheries of walrus aggregations at a commonly used haulout near Point Lay, Alaska, in 2018–2020. We evaluated optical and radar imagery ranging in pixel resolutions from 40 m to \textbackslashtextasciitilde1 m: specifically, optical imagery from Landsat, Sentinel-2, Planet Labs, and DigitalGlobe, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X. Three observers independently examined satellite images to detect walrus aggregations and digitized their peripheries using visual interpretation. We compared interpretations between observers and to high-resolution (\textbackslashtextasciitilde2 cm) ortho-corrected imagery collected by a small unoccupied aerial system (UAS). Roughly two-thirds of the time, clouds precluded clear optical views of the study area from satellite. SAR was unaffected by clouds (and darkness) and provided unambiguous signatures of walrus aggregations at the Point Lay haulout. Among imagery types with 4–10 m resolution, observers unanimously agreed on all detections of walruses, and attained an average 65\% overlap (sd 12.0, n 100) in their delineations of aggregation boundaries. For imagery with \textbackslashtextasciitilde1 m resolution, overlap agreement was higher (mean 85\%, sd 3.0, n 11). We found that optical satellite sensors with moderate resolution and high revisitation rates, such as PlanetScope and Sentinel-2, demonstrated robust and repeatable qualities for monitoring walrus haulouts, but temporal gaps between observations due to clouds were common. SAR imagery also demonstrated robust capabilities for monitoring the Point Lay haulout, but more research is needed to evaluate SAR at haulouts with more complex local terrain and beach substrates.}},

abstract = {{Area-based measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) are important for understanding earth system processes such as glacier mass balance, winter hydrological storage in drainage basins and ground thermal regimes. Remote sensing techniques are ideally suited for wide-scale area-based mapping with the most commonly used technique to measure SWE being passive-microwave, which is limited to coarse spatial resolutions of 25 km or greater, and to areas without significant topographic variation. Passive-microwave also has a negative bias for large SWE. Repeat-pass synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) as an alternate technique allows measurement of SWE change at much higher spatial resolution. However, it has not been widely adopted because: (1) the phase unwrapping problem has not been robustly addressed, especially for interferograms with poor coherence and; (2) SWE change maps scaled directly from repeat-pass interferograms are not an absolute measurement but contain unknown offsets for each contiguous coherent area. We develop and test a novel method for repeat-pass InSAR based dry-snow SWE estimation that exploits the sensitivity of the dry-snow refraction-induced InSAR phase to topographic variations. The method robustly estimates absolute SWE change at spatial resolutions of < 1 km, without the need for phase unwrapping. We derive a quantitative signal model for this new SWE change estimator and identify the relevant sources of bias. The method is demonstrated using both simulated SWE distributions and a 9-year RADARSAT-2 spotlight-mode dataset near Inuvik, NWT, Canada. SWE results are compared to in situ snow survey measurements and estimates from ERA5 reanalysis. Our method performs well in high-relief areas and in areas with high SWE (> 150 mm), thus providing complementary coverage to other passive- and active-microwave based SWE estimation methods. Further, our method has the advantage of requiring only a single wavelength band and thus can utilize existing spaceborne synthetic aperture radar systems. In application, a first order analysis of SWE trends within three drainage basins suggests that differences between basin-level accumulations are a function of major landcover types, and that re-vegetation following a forest-tundra fire that occurred over 50 years ago continues to affect the spatial distribution of SWE accumulation in the study area.}},

There is a need to improve monitoring capabilities in order to reliably detect and locate avalanche activity, which will help to validate avalanche hazard assessments. Recent work has demonstrated the utility of infrasound as it can provide continuous monitoring and broad geographic coverage. Here, we present the first use of infrasound to monitor snow avalanche activity in a maritime climate along the Milford Road in Fiordland, New Zealand (Aotearoa). Size 4 (or larger) plunging avalanches frequently occur along the Milford Road, which travels through a glacial-carved valley with steep cliffs (slope angles can exceed 50∘) that are over 1000 m tall. We deployed two infrasound arrays on the eastern side of the Homer Tunnel and recorded triggered and natural avalanches during our month-long field campaign. We use array processing to identify avalanche signals, calculate back-azimuths, and triangulate source locations. Source locations are well constrained for avalanches that are in-network but are worse for avalanches that occur out-of-network, likely due to topographic scattering of acoustic waves from the steep valley walls. The infrasound amplitudes are substantially larger than previously recorded at other locations with a maximum peak-to-peak amplitude of 37 Pa detected for a large triggered avalanche, which reflects the unique dynamics of the avalanches along the Milford Road. This study demonstrates the utility of infrasound for snow avalanche monitoring in maritime climates and showcases an efficient processing workflow that could be easily operationalized.}},

We first modified the Chang algorithm and then validated it using meteorological observation data, considering the influences from vegetation, wet snow, precipitation, cold desert and frozen ground. Furthermore, the modified algorithm is dynamically adjusted based on the seasonal variation of grain size and snow density. Snow-depth distribution is indirectly validated by MODIS snow-cover products by comparing the snow-extent area from this work. The final snow-depth datasets from 1978 to 2006 show that the interannual snow-depth variation is very significant. The spatial and temporal distribution of snow depth is illustrated and discussed, including the steady snow-cover regions in China and snow-mass trend in these regions. Though the areal extent of seasonal snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere indicates a weak decrease over a long period, there is no clear trend in change of snow-cover area extent in China. However, snow mass over the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau and northwestern China has increased, while it has weakly decreased in northeastern China.

abstract = {{Since their development in the 1960s, seismic arrays have given a new impulse to seismology. Recordings from many uniform seismometers in a well-defined, closely spaced configuration produce high-quality and homogeneous data sets, which can be used to study the Earth's structure in great detail. Apart from an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio due to the simple summation of the individual array recordings, seismological arrays can be used in many different ways to study the fine-scale structure of the Earth's interior. They have helped to study such different structures as the interior of volcanos, continental crust and lithosphere, global variations of seismic velocities in the mantle, the core-mantle boundary and the structure of the inner core. For this purpose many different, specialized array techniques have been developed and applied to an increasing number of high-quality array data sets. Most array methods use the ability of seismic arrays to measure the vector velocity of an incident wave front, i.e., slowness and back azimuth. This information can be used to distinguish between different seismic phases, separate waves from different seismic events and improve the signal-to-noise ratio by stacking with respect to the varying slowness of different phases. The vector velocity information of scattered or reflected phases can be used to determine the region of the Earth from whence the seismic energy comes and with what structures it interacted. Therefore seismic arrays are perfectly suited to study the small-scale structure and variations of the material properties of the Earth. In this review we will give an introduction to various array techniques which have been developed since the 1960s. For each of these array techniques we give the basic mathematical equations and show examples of applications. The advantages and disadvantages and the appropriate applications and restrictions of the techniques will also be discussed. The main methods discussed are the beam-forming method, which forms the basis for several other methods, different slant stacking techniques, and frequency–wave number analysis. Finally, some methods used in exploration geophysics that have been adopted for global seismology are introduced. This is followed by a description of temporary and permanent arrays installed in the past, as well as existing arrays and seismic networks. We highlight their purposes and discuss briefly the advantages and disadvantages of different array configurations.}},

The goal of this work was to further understand the dielectric permittivity of seasonal snow under both dry and wet conditions. We utilized extensive direct field observations of k, along with corresponding snow density and liquid water content (LWC) measurements. Data were collected in the Jemez Mountains, NM; Sandia Mountains, NM; Grand Mesa, CO; and Cameron Pass, CO from February 2020 to May 2021. We present empirical relationships based on 146 snow pits for dry snow conditions and 92 independent LWC observations in naturally melting snowpacks. Regression results had r2 values of 0.57 and 0.37 for dry and wet snow conditions, respectively. Our results in dry snow showed large differences between our in situ observations and commonly applied equations. We attribute these differences to assumptions in the shape of the snow grains that may not hold true for seasonal snow applications. Different assumptions, and thus different equations, may be necessary for varying snowpack conditions in different climates, suggesting that further testing is necessary. When considering wet snow, large differences were found between commonly applied equations and our in situ measurements. Many previous equations assume a background (dry snow) k that we found to be inaccurate, as previously stated, and is the primary driver of resulting uncertainty. Our results suggest large errors in SWE (10–15\%) or LWC (0.05–0.07 volumetric LWC) estimates based on current equations. The work presented here could prove useful for making accurate observations of changes in SWE using future InSAR opportunities such as NISAR and ROSE-L.}},

abstract = {{The dense media radiative transfer (DMRT) theory is applied to data analysis of recent measurements of multifrequency microwave backscatter from the snow cover on earth. Measurement includes ground-based campaign (SnowScat) and airborne mission (SnowSAR). Both the quasi-crystalline approximation (QCA) model and the bicontinuous model are used for a multilayer snow medium. Two size parameters are used for both models. Grain size and stickiness parameter are used for QCA model. The bicontinuous model has two parameters: the mean wave number \$\textbackslashlangle \textbackslashbm\{\textbackslashzeta \}\textbackslashrangle\$ and the parameter \$\{\textbackslashbm\{b\}\}\$. The mean wave number \$\textbackslashlangle \textbackslashbm\{\textbackslashzeta\}\textbackslashrangle \$ corresponds to the inverse of the grain size, while the \$\{\textbackslashbm\{b\}\}\$ parameter controls the width of the wave number distribution and is related to the clustering property. The bicontinuous model is used to generate the microstructures of snow by computer, and Maxwell equations are solved numerically for each sample of computer-generated structure to calculate the extinction coefficient and the phase matrix. Other geometric descriptors of the bicontinuous medium include correlation functions and specific surface areas, both of which can be calculated from the parameters \$\textbackslashlangle \textbackslashbm\{\textbackslashzeta \}\textbackslashrangle \$ and \$\{\textbackslashbm\{b\}\}\$. In making comparisons, we use ground measurements of specific surface area, grain size, densities, and layering of snow cover as input for the theoretical models. The geometric properties and the scattering properties of the bicontinuous model are also compared with past models. In making the multifrequency comparisons, we use the same physical parameters of all three frequencies: 1)X band; 2)Ku bands of 13.3GHz; and 3)16.7GHz. It is emphasized that the DMRT models provide frequency, size, and angular dependence that depart from the classical model of Rayleigh scattering and are in better agreement with experimental observations.}},

Monthly snow water equivalent (SWE) measurements were combined from two datasets to provide sufficient data from 1930 to 2008. The monthly snapshots are used to calculate peak snow mass timing for each snow season. Since 1930, there has been an overall trend toward earlier snow mass peak timing by 0.6 days per decade. The trend toward earlier timing also occurs at nearly all individual stations. Even stations showing an increase in 1 April SWE exhibit the trend toward earlier timing, indicating that enhanced melting is occurring at nearly all stations. Analysis of individual years and stations reveals that warm daily maximum temperatures averaged over March and April are associated with earlier snow mass peak timing for all spatial and temporal scales included in the dataset. The influence is particularly pronounced for low accumulation years indicating the potential importance of albedo feedback for the melting of shallow snow. The robustness of the early spring temperature influence on peak timing suggests the trend toward earlier peak timing is attributable to the simultaneous warming trend (0.1°C decade−1 since 1930, with an acceleration in warming in later time periods). Given future scenarios of warming in California, one can expect acceleration in the trend toward earlier peak timing; this will reduce the warm season storage capacity of the California snowpack.}},

The polarimetric data were acquired over the Sodankylä test site in Finland together with in situ measurements of the soil and the snow cover. The analyses indicate clearly that the dynamics of the polarimetric entropy and mean scattering alpha angle are directly correlated to soil freezing and thawing states, even under distinct dry snow cover. First modeling attempts using the Extended Bragg soil scattering model justify the observed trends, which indicate surface-like scattering during frozen soil conditions and multiple/volume scattering for thawed soils.

To calibrate and validate the method, the Emma Storm, a severe coastal storm that affected the southwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula in 2018, was chosen as a case study. A coastal land use/land cover method optimization by optical and UAV field data resulted in an overall improvement of about 20\% in the identification of disaster-affected areas by reducing false alarms by up to 33\%. Finally, the method achieved hit and false alarm rates of about 80\% and 20\%, respectively, leading to the identification of approximately 30\% (7000 ha) of the study area as being affected by the storm. Marshes and vegetated dunes were the most significantly impacted covers. In addition, SAR data enabled the impact assessment with a time lag of 2 days, contrasting the 25-day delay of optical data. The proposed method stands out as a valuable tool for regional-scale coastal disaster monitoring. In addition, it can be automated and operated at a low cost, making it a valuable tool for decision-making support.}},

Interactions between these different processes create spatially variable patterns of snow depth across a landscape. Variations in accumulation and redistribution occur at a variety of spatial scales, which are well established for moderate mountain terrain. However, spatial patterns of snow depth variability in steep, complex mountain terrain have not been fully explored due to insufficient spatial resolutions of snow depth measurement. Recent advances in uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) and structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry provide an opportunity to map spatially continuous snow depths at high resolutions in these environments. Using UASs and SfM photogrammetry, we produced 11 snow depth maps at a steep couloir site in the Bridger Range of Montana, USA, during the 2019–2020 winter. We quantified the spatial scales of snow depth variability in this complex mountain terrain at a variety of resolutions over 2 orders of magnitude (0.02 to 20 m) and time steps (4 to 58 d) using variogram analysis in a high-performance computing environment. We found that spatial resolutions greater than 0.5 m do not capture the complete patterns of snow depth spatial variability within complex mountain terrain and that snow depths are autocorrelated within horizontal distances of 15 m at our study site. The results of this research have the potential to reduce uncertainty currently associated with snowpack and snow water resource analysis by documenting and quantifying snow depth variability and snowpack evolution on relatively inaccessible slopes in complex terrain at high spatial and temporal resolutions.}},

The sample coherence magnitude is calculated over a moving window to generate a coherence magnitude map. High-resolution coherence maps may be useful to discriminate fine structures. Coarser resolution is needed for a more accurate estimation of the coherence magnitude. In this study, the accuracy of coherence estimation is investigated as a function of the coherence map resolution. It is shown that the space-averaged coherence magnitude is biased toward higher values. The accuracy of the coherence magnitude estimate obtained is a function of the number of pixels averaged and the number of independent samples per pixel (i.e., the coherence map resolution). A method is proposed to remove the bias from the space-averaged sample coherence magnitude. Coherence magnitude estimation from complex (magnitude and phase) coherence maps is also considered. It is established that the magnitude of the averaged sample coherence estimate is slightly biased for high-resolution coherence maps and that the bias reduces with coarser resolution. Finally, coherence estimation for nonstationary targets is discussed. It is shown that the averaged sample coherence obtained from complex coherence maps or coherence magnitude maps is suitable for estimation of nonstationary coherence. The averaged sample (complex) coherence permits the calculation of an unbiased coherence estimate, provided that the original signals can be assumed to be locally stationary over a sufficiently coarse resolution cell.}},

At present, quantification of frontal position change primarily relies on time-consuming and subjective manual mapping techniques, limiting our ability to understand changes to glacier calving fronts. Here we describe a newly developed automated method of mapping glacier calving fronts in satellite imagery using observations from a representative sample of Greenland’s peripheral marine-terminating glaciers. Our method is adapted from the 2-D wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) segmentation method, which has been used previously for image segmentation in biomedical and other applied science fields. The gradient-based method places edge detection lines along regions with the greatest intensity gradient in the image, such as the contrast between glacier ice and water or glacier ice and sea ice. The lines corresponding to the calving front are identified using thresholds for length, average gradient value, and orientation that minimize the misfit with respect to a manual validation data set. We demonstrate that the method is capable of mapping glacier calving fronts over a wide range of image conditions (light to intermediate cloud cover, dim or bright, mélange presence, etc.). With these time series, we are able to resolve subseasonal to multiyear temporal patterns as well as regional patterns in glacier frontal position change.}},

Satellite remote sensing has been largely unable to reliably detect the amount of snowpack in these areas. Recently, C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from the Sentinel-1 (S1) satellites have shown potential for measuring snow depth in the mountains. However, their spatiotemporal coverage is incomplete, and their evaluation with robust, aerial snow depth data is limited. Here, we evaluate two S1 snowpack datasets with some of the best available gridded snowpack data over the Colorado Rockies and Sierra Nevada mountains in the western US: the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) and the University of Arizona (UA) snowpack datasets. Compared to ASO and UA data, the S1 data are biased high when snow is shallow, and biased low when snow is deep (particularly later in spring when there is wet snow), though these biases are reduced for deep snow areas when wet snow pixels are removed. We then apply corrections based on machine learning that account for physiographic characteristics to improve the accuracy of the S1 data. Furthermore, we fill gaps in the S1 data by using snow persistence, but also account for potential snow accumulation and ablation, to generate temporally complete snow depth maps over mountainous areas. Corrected and gap-filled S1 snow depth mapping could be especially important for snow monitoring in remote mountain areas where other techniques for snow mapping do not work or are logistically infeasible or cost-prohibitive.}},

In addition, area‐averaged simulations of SWE based on different types of spatial discretization are evaluated. Spatial variability of SWE is shaped by a range of different processes that occur across a hierarchy of spatial scales. Spatial variability at the watershed‐scale is shaped by variability in near‐surface meteorological fields (e.g., elevation gradients in temperature) and, provided suitable meteorological data is available, can be explicitly resolved by spatial interpolation/extrapolation. On the other hand, spatial variability of SWE at the hillslope‐scale is governed by processes such as drifting, sloughing of snow off steep slopes, trapping of snow by shrubs, and the nonuniform unloading of snow by the forest canopy, which are more difficult to resolve explicitly. Subgrid probability distributions are often capable of representing the aggregate‐impact of unresolved processes at the hillslope‐scale, though they may not adequately capture the effects of elevation gradients. While the best modeling strategy is case‐specific, the analysis in this paper provides guidance on both the suitability of several common snow modeling approaches and on the choice of parameter values in subgrid probability distributions.

These results suggest that atmospheric constituents contained in snow can be anisotropically mixed depending on the wind environment and snow structure, having implications for surface snow reaction rates and interpretation of firn and ice cores.}},

abstract = {{Avalanche disasters are extremely destructive and catastrophic, often causing serious casualties, economic losses and surface erosion. However, far too little attention has been paid to utilizing remote sensing mapping avalanches quickly and automatically to mitigate calamity. Such endeavors are limited by formidable natural conditions, human subjective judgement and insufficient understanding of avalanches, so they have been incomplete and inaccurate. This paper presents an objective and widely serviceable method for regional auto-detection using the scattering and interference characteristics of avalanches extracted from Sentinel-1 SLC images. Six indices are established to distinguish avalanches from surrounding undisturbed snow. The active avalanche belts in Kizilkeya and Aktep of the Western TianShan Mountains in China lend urgency to this research. Implementation found that smaller avalanches can be consistently identified more accurately in descending images. Specifically, 281 and 311 avalanches were detected in the ascending and descending of Kizilkeya, respectively. The corresponding numbers on Aktep are 104 and 114, respectively. The resolution area of single avalanche detection can reach 0.09 km2. The performance of the model was excellent in all cases (areas under the curve are 0.831 and 0.940 in descending and ascending of Kizilkeya, respectively; and 0.807 and 0.938 of Aktep, respectively). Overall, the evaluation of statistical indices are POD > 0.75, FAR < 0.34, FOM < 0.13 and TSS > 0.75. The results indicate that the performance of the innovation proposed in this paper, which employs multivariate comprehensive descriptions of avalanche characteristics to actualize regional automatic detection, can be more objective, accurate, applicable and robust to a certain extent. The latest and more complete avalanche inventory generated by this design can effectively assist in addressing the increasingly severe avalanche disasters and improving public awareness of avalanches in alpine areas.}},

Meteorological data from automatic weather stations were interpolated to 100 m horizontal resolution and precipitation was scaled with snow depth measurements from airborne laser scanning. Modeled snow instability metrics assessed for two different weak layers suggested that the weak layer closer to the snow surface was more variable. Initially, it was less stable than the weak layer closer to the ground, yet it stabilized faster as the winter progressed. In spring, the simulated snowpack on south-facing slopes stabilized faster than on north-facing slopes, in line with the regional avalanche forecast. In the winter months January to March 2017, simulated instability metrics did not suggest that the snowpack on south-facing slopes was more stable, as reported in the regional avalanche forecast. Although a validation with field data is lacking, these model results still show the potential and challenges of distributed modeling for supporting operational avalanche forecasting.}},

Yet, traditional monitoring techniques, such as punctual measurements in the field, do not cover the full snowpack spatial and temporal variability, which hampers efforts to upscale measurements to the global scale. This variability is one of the primary constraints in model development. In terms of spatial resolution, active microwaves (synthetic aperture radar—SAR) can address the issue and outperform methods based on passive microwaves. Thus, high spatial resolution monitoring of snow depth (SD) would allow for better parameterization of local processes that drive the spatial variability of snow. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of the TerraSAR-X (TSX) SAR sensor and the wave co-polar phase difference (CPD) method for characterizing snow cover at high spatial resolution. Consequently, we first (1) quantified the spatio-temporal variability of the geophysical properties of the snowpack in an Arctic catchment, we then (2) studied the links between snow properties and CPD, considering ground vegetation. Snow depth (SD) could be extracted using the CPD when certain conditions are met. A high incidence angle (> 30°) with a high Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) (> 7.0) showed correlation between SD and CPD (R-squared up to 0.72). Further, future work should address a threshold of sensitivity to TWI and incidence angle to map snow depth in such environments and assess the potential of using interpolation tools to fill in gaps in SD information on drier vegetation types.}},

Results are negatively biased (median difference of −0.22 m) when compared against observations from a terrestrial Light Detection And Ranging scan, though replicate general snow depth variability well. Additionally, the Pléiades dataset is subject to data gaps (17\% of total pixels), negative values for shallow snow (12\%), and noise on slopes >40–50° (2\%). We correct and filter the Pléiades snow depths using surface classification techniques of snow‐free areas and a random forest model for data gap filling. Snow depths (with an estimated error of \textbackslashtextasciitilde0.36 m) average 1.66 m and relate well to topographical parameters such as elevation and northness in a similar way to previous studies. However, estimations of snow depth based upon topography (TOPO) or physically based modeling (DBSM) cannot resolve localized processes (i.e., avalanching or wind scouring) that are detected by Pléiades, even when forced with locally calibrated data. Comparing these alternative model approaches to corrected Pléiades snow depths reveals total snow volume differences between −28\% (DBSM) and +54\% (TOPO) for the catchment and large differences across most elevation bands. Pléiades represents an important contribution to understanding snow accumulation at sparsely monitored catchments, though ideally requires a careful systematic validation procedure to identify catchment‐scale biases and errors in the snow depth derivation.

Global warming is projected to drive widespread decreases in snow accumulation by the end of the century, potentially affecting water, food, and energy supplies, seasonal heat extremes, and wildfire risk. However, over the next few decades, when the planning and implementation of current adaptation responses are most relevant, the snow response is more uncertain, largely because of uncertainty in regional and local precipitation trends. We use a large (40-member) single-model ensemble climate model experiment to examine the influence of precipitation variability on the direction and magnitude of near-term Northern Hemisphere snow trends. We find that near-term uncertainty in the sign of regional precipitation change does not cascade into uncertainty in the sign of regional snow accumulation change. Rather, temperature increases drive statistically robust consistency in the sign of future near-term snow accumulation trends, with all regions exhibiting reductions in the fraction of precipitation falling as snow, along with mean decreases in late-season snow accumulation. However, internal variability does create uncertainty in the magnitude of hemispheric and regional snow changes, including uncertainty as large as 33 \% of the baseline mean. In addition, within the 40-member ensemble, many mid-latitude grid points exhibit at least one realization with a statistically significant positive trend in net snow accumulation, and at least one realization with a statistically significant negative trend. These results suggest that the direction of near-term snow accumulation change is robust at the regional scale, but that internal variability can influence the magnitude and direction of snow accumulation changes at the local scale, even in areas that exhibit a high signal-to-noise ratio.}},

The SCA product was the fraction of each 1 km2 pixel covered by snow and was derived from NOAA advanced very high‐resolution radiometer imagery. The SWE product was developed by multiplying the SCA product by SWE estimates interpolated from National Resources Conservation Service snow telemetry point measurements for a 6 year period (1995‐2000). Measured SCA and SWE estimates were consistently lower than values estimated from temperature and precipitation within PRMS. The greatest differences occurred in the relatively complex terrain of the Rio Grande basin, as opposed to the relatively homogeneous terrain of the Black River basin, where differences were small. Differences between modelled and measured snow were different for the accumulation period versus the ablation period and had an elevational trend. Assimilating the measured snowfields into a version of PRMS calibrated to achieve water balance without assimilation led to reduced performance in estimating streamflow for the Rio Grande and increased performance in estimating streamflow for the Black River basin. Correcting the measured SCA and SWE for canopy effects improved simulations by adding snow mostly in the mid‐to‐high elevations, where satellite estimates of SCA are lower than model estimates.

abstract = {{Despite widespread warming in mountain regions, little research to date has explored the physical mechanisms driving the variable response of snowpacks to changes in climate, instead focusing primarily on empirical relationships, such as seasonal air temperature or elevation. In this work, we evaluate how differences in snowfall fraction, cold content, and the snowpack energy balance produce simulated changes to snow accumulation and melt at an alpine and subalpine snowpack in the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research site. For our analysis, we created a 23 years baseline simulation using the SNOWPACK model forced by historical hourly meteorological data from water year 1991 through 2013. We then perturbed hourly air temperature in 0.5°C increments from +0.5 to +4.0°C above baseline and increased incoming longwave radiation accordingly. For every 1°C of warming, peak snow water equivalent declined by 43.9 mm in the alpine and 54.3 mm in the subalpine, melt onset shifted 6.2 days earlier in the alpine and 8.8 days in the subalpine, the snow season shortened by 10.7 days in the alpine and 16.4 days in the subalpine, and melt rate increased by 0.2 mm d−1 in the alpine while decreasing by 0.4 mm d−1 in the subalpine. We found the alpine snowpack was less sensitive to warming for three primary reasons: (1) Snowfall fraction decreased less rapidly per 1°C of warming than in the subalpine; (2) Cold content still consistently developed throughout the snow season, preventing mid-winter melt events; (3) Changes to snowmelt rate were not significant because increases to the turbulent fluxes balanced decreases in the radiative fluxes with earlier snowmelt onset. Additionally, at 3°C of warming and greater, the subalpine site experienced a fundamental shift where significant melt could occur throughout the entirety of the winter as cold content was no longer large enough to buffer against positive energy fluxes. In some years, the subalpine snowpack became transient with several cycles of accumulation and melt per winter. This tipping point suggests sites with lower cold content—like the subalpine studied here—are likely to be more sensitive to producing increased winter melt as warming continues over the coming decades.}},

Uncertainties for plume heights are large, especially for bent-over plumes in which the ascent dynamics are strongly affected by the surrounding wind field. Here we show how uncertainties can be reduced if MER is derived directly from geophysical observations of source dynamics. The combination of infrasound measurements and thermal camera imagery allows for the infrasonic type of source to be constrained (a dipole in this case) and for the plume exit velocity to be calculated (54–142m/s) based on the acoustic signal recorded during the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption from 4 to 21 May. Exit velocities are converted into MER using additional information on vent diameter (50±10m) and mixture density (5.4±1.1kg/m3), resulting in an average ∼9×105kg/s MER during the considered period of the eruption. We validate our acoustic-derived MER by using independent measurements of plume heights (Icelandic Meteorological Office radar observations). Acoustically derived MER are converted into plume heights using field-based relationships and a 1D radially averaged buoyant plume theory model using a reconstructed total grain size distribution. We conclude that the use of infrasonic monitoring may lead to important understanding of the plume dynamics and allows for real-time determination of eruption source parameters.

We compare the baseline regression approach to our new regression in the context of spatial snow surveys and operational snow measuring stations. When compared to independent distributed snow surveys, the new regression reduces the bias of SWE estimates from −5.5\% to 0.8\%, and RMSE of the SWE estimates by 8\% from 0.25 m to 0.23 m. Notable improvements were observed in alpine terrain with bias declining from −38\% to only 3.4\%, and RMSE was reduced by 13\%, from 0.47 to 0.41 m. The mean increase in cross‐validated r2 for the new regression compared to the baseline regression is from 0.22 to 0.33. The largest increase in r2 in any one year is 0.19, an 83\% improvement. The new regression estimates, on average, 31\% greater SWE depth than the baseline regression in areas above 3000 m elevation, which contributes up to 66\% of annual SWE volume in the driest year. This indicates that the historical SWE patterns from the reconstruction adds information to the interpolation beyond the physiographic conditions represented by the SNOTEL network. Given that previous works using SWE reconstructions were limited to retrospective analyses by necessity, the work presented here represents an important contribution in that it extends SWE reconstructions to real‐time applications and illustrates that doing so significantly improves the accuracy of SWE estimates. Real‐time SWE estimates are generated by merging remotely sensed and ground‐based snow data Past spatial patterns of snowpack improve real‐time regression‐based estimates of SWE Improvements are particularly notable in unsampled locations}},

abstract = {{A methodology for quantifying the accuracy of snow depth measurement are demonstrated in this study by using the equation of error propagation for the same type sensors and by compariong autimatic measurement with manual observation. Snow depth was measured at the Centre for Atmospheric Research Experiments (CARE) site of the Environment Canada (EC) during the 2013–2014 winter experiment. The snow depth measurement system at the CARE site was comprised of three bases. Three ultrasonic and one laser snow depth sensors and twelve snow stakes were placed on each base. Data from snow depth sensors are quality-controlled by range check and step test to eliminate erroneous data such as outliers and discontinuities. In comparison with manual observations, bias errors were calculated to show the spatial distribution of snow depth by considering snow depth measured from four snow stakes located on the easternmost side of the site as reference. The bias error of snow stakes on the west side of the site was largest. The uncertainty of all pairs of stakes and the average uncertainty for each base were 1.81 and 1.52 cm, respectively. The bias error and normalized bias removed root mean square error (NBRRMSE) for each snow depth sensor were calculated to quantify the systematic error and random error in comparison of snow depth sensors with manual observations that share the same snow depth target. The snow depth sensors on base 12A (11A) measured snow depth larger (less) than manual observation up to 10.8 cm (5.21 cm), and the NBRRMSEs ranged from 5.10 to 16.5 \%. Finally, the instrumental uncertainties of each snow depth sensor were calculated by comparing three sensors of the same type installed at the different bases. The instrumental uncertainties ranged from 0.62 to 3.08 cm.}},

abstract = {{Predicting metamorphism within seasonal snowpacks is critical for avalanche forecasting and runoﬀ timing as it relates to water supply management. Snowpack temperature gradients play a key role in snow metamorphism, and their magnitude controls how snow strength changes; therefore, they are of interest to avalanche forecasters. Before major melt, the snowpack must warm to isothermal conditions at 0°C. Measuring this transition from warming to the ripening phase could help improve our current models for runoﬀ timing. Measuring snowpack temperature gradients is currently a non-automated process that requires disturbance of the snow proﬁle, and only gives a snapshot in time of the temperature conditions. Here we demonstrate an automated method to monitor in situ snowpack temperature using a thermocouple array, co-located with the Banner Summit SNOTEL site in central Idaho. Showing the location and duration of critical temperature gradients helps avalanche forecasters detect warning signs related to possible facet formation. During the 2019 winter, we observed large temperature gradients in the bottom 20cm of the snowpack, with the gradient falling below critical (<0.1°C/cm) by early January. Critical gradients were observed near the surface throughout the winter, and temperatures were within ± 0.06 °C of the melting point when the snowpack became isothermal in the spring. We anticipate this dataset will inform snowpack energy balance models and aid in the prediction of avalanche hazards and runoﬀ timing.}}

abstract = {{The related challenges of predictions in ungauged basins and predictions in ungauged climates point to the need to develop environmental models that are transferable across both space and time. Hydrologic modeling has historically focused on modelling one or only a few basins using highly parameterized conceptual or physically based models. However, model parameters and structures have been shown to change significantly when calibrated to new basins or time periods, suggesting that model complexity and model transferability may be antithetical. Empirical space‐for‐time models provide a framework within which to assess model transferability and any tradeoff with model complexity. Using 497 SNOTEL sites in the western U.S., we develop space‐for‐time models of April 1 SWE and Snow Residence Time based on mean winter temperature and cumulative winter precipitation. The transferability of the models to new conditions (in both space and time) is assessed using non‐random cross‐validation tests with consideration of the influence of model complexity on transferability. As others have noted, the algorithmic empirical models transfer best when minimal extrapolation in input variables is required. Temporal split‐sample validations use pseudoreplicated samples, resulting in the selection of overly complex models, which has implications for the design of hydrologic model validation tests. Finally, we show that low to moderate complexity models transfer most successfully to new conditions in space and time, providing empirical confirmation of the parsimony principal. A challenge for environmental modeling and prediction is to create models that work everywhere. This includes places where we don't have data and it also includes the future. An additional challenge is choosing an appropriate model for these new conditions.To select a model, we built snow models of varying complexity and evaluated how well they predicted snowpack in new locations and time periods. The models performed well when applied to new time periods since certain environmental variables remained constant over time, including shading and solar radiation, resulting in the time samples being statistically dependent. For these applications, validation tended to select overly complex models. When applied to new locations, the models provided good predictions as long as the conditions in the new location were not drastically different from the conditions the model was trained on. Finally, we found that simple to moderate‐complexity models did better than complex models at predicting in new conditions. A top‐down conceptual representation of snow storage showed strong transferability across a range of challenging validation tests Low to moderate complexity models transfer most successfully to new conditions Validation‐based model selection favors overfit models when calibration and validation samples are pseudoreplicated}},

To investigate this partitioning, we use endmember splitting and mixing analyses based on stable isotope (18O) data from nine headwater catchments in the East River, Colorado. Our results show that one third of the snow partitions to ET and 13\% of the snowmelt sustains summer streamflow. Only 8\% of the rainfall contributes to the summer streamflow, because most of the rain (67\%) partitions to ET. The spatial variability of precipitation partitioning is mainly driven by aspect and tree cover across the sub‐catchments. Catchments with higher tree cover have a higher share of snow becoming ET, resulting in less snow in summer streamflow. Summer streamflow did not contain more rain with higher rainfall sums, but more rain was taken up in ET. Snowmelt from the Rocky Mountains is crucial for the water supply in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB). With reduced snowpack and earlier snowmelt due to climate change, it is important to understand how much of the snow directly contributes to streamflow and how much returns directly to the atmosphere via evaporation and vegetation use, called evapotranspiration (ET). We applied a stable isotope mass balance approach to investigate this for nine catchments in the UCRB. We found that snow sustains not only most the streamflow but also ¾ of the ET. Rainfall was mostly (2/3) lost to the atmosphere through ET. The variation of the snow and rain contributions to streamflow and ET were mainly driven by the catchment aspect and tree cover. The findings show that the timing of snowmelt (influenced by aspect) and plant water use (influenced by tree cover) determined how much snow became streamflow and ET. For the mountainous catchments in the Upper Colorado River, the fate of snow (rain) is 33\% (67\%) evapotranspiration (ET) and 13\% (8\%) summer streamflow In catchments with relatively higher tree cover, snow was more likely to evapotranspire with less rain and snow sustaining streamflow Increased rainfall led to greater share of rain in ET rather than streamflow, while snowfall variation had little effect For the mountainous catchments in the Upper Colorado River, the fate of snow (rain) is 33\% (67\%) evapotranspiration (ET) and 13\% (8\%) summer streamflow In catchments with relatively higher tree cover, snow was more likely to evapotranspire with less rain and snow sustaining streamflow Increased rainfall led to greater share of rain in ET rather than streamflow, while snowfall variation had little effect}},

The full tensor of the effective thermal conductivity (keff) was computed from 30 three-dimensional images of the snow microstructure, spanning all types of seasonal snow. Only conduction through ice and interstitial air were considered. The obtained values are strongly correlated to snow density. The main cause for the slight scatter around the regression curve to snow density is the anisotropy of keff: the vertical component of keff of facetted crystals and depth hoar samples is up to 1.5 times larger than the horizontal component, while rounded grains sampled deeply in the snowpack exhibit the inverse behavior. Results of simulations neglecting the conduction in the interstitial air indicate that this phase plays a vital role in heat conduction through snow. The computed effective thermal conductivity is found to increase with decreasing temperature, mostly following the temperature dependency of the thermal conductivity of ice. The results are compared to experimental data obtained either with the needle-probe technique or using combined measurements of the vertical heat flux and the corresponding temperature gradient. Needle-probe measurements are systematically significantly lower than those from the two other techniques. The observed discrepancies between the three methods are investigated and briefly discussed.}},

We trained random forest models using combinations of multispectral bands and normalized difference indices (i.e., NDVI) to produce land cover maps for priority feature classes (snow, shaded snow, vegetation, water, and exposed ground). We then created snow-covered area products from these maps and compared them with coarser resolution satellite fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) products from Landsat (\textbackslashtextasciitilde30 m) and MODIS (\textbackslashtextasciitilde500 m). Our models generated accurate classifications, even with limited combinations of available multispectral bands. Models trained on a single image demonstrated limited model transfer, with best results found for in-region transfers. Coarser-resolution Landsat and MODSCAG fSCA products identified many more pixels as completely snow-covered (100\% fSCA) than WV fSCA. However, while MODSCAG fSCA products also identified many more completely snow-free pixels (0\% fSCA) than WV fSCA, Landsat fSCA products only slightly underestimated the number of completely snow-free pixels. Overall, our results demonstrate that strategic image observations with VHR satellites such as WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 can complement the existing operational snow data products to map the evolution of seasonal snow cover.}},

Multilooking or spatial averaging is commonly used to reduce stochastic noise over a neighborhood of distributed scatterers in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements. However, multilooking may break consistency among a triplet of interferometric phases formed from three acquisitions leading to a residual phase error called closure phase. Understanding the cause of closure phase in multilooked InSAR measurements and the impact of closure phase errors on the performance of InSAR time-series algorithms is crucial for quantifying the uncertainty of ground displacement time series derived from InSAR measurements. We develop a model that consistently explains both closure phase and systematic bias in multilooked interferometric measurements. We show that nonzero closure phase can be an indicator of temporally inconsistent physical processes that alter both phase and amplitude of interferometric measurements. We propose a method to estimate the systematic bias in the InSAR time series with generalized closure phase measurements. We validate our model with a case study in Barstow-Bristol Trough, CA, USA. We find systematic differences on the order of cm/year between InSAR time-series results using subsets of varying maximum temporal baselines.

We present a scalable approach to map snowmelt runoff onset using Sentinel‐1 synthetic aperture radar data for the past 8 years with 10 m spatial resolution and a median temporal resolution of 3.9 days. A systematic analysis of stratovolcanoes in the Western United States showed that snowmelt runoff onset is strongly dependent on elevation (r = 0.81), with a median runoff onset lapse rate of 4.9 days per 100 m of elevation gain. During the 2015 snow drought, we observed snowmelt runoff onset 25 days early relative to the 2015–2022 median. We document a median shift in snowmelt runoff onset of +2.0 days later in the year per year between 2016 and 2022. Our open‐source tools can be used to create snowmelt runoff onset maps anywhere on Earth. Snowmelt timing is important–knowing when water leaves mountain snowpack is critical for downstream water resource applications like irrigation and hydropower. Snowmelt timing is also affected by regional climate change. However, it is hard to make detailed measurements of when and where snow melts across mountainous regions. We developed an improved method to map snowmelt using satellite based radar data, and we applied this method to study snow on mountains in the Western United States. We documented the detailed relationship between elevation and snowmelt, and how this relationship changed over the past 8 years. In general, at higher elevations and latitudes, snow melts later in the year. We also observed snow melting much earlier than it usually does during the 2015 snow drought, which helps us prepare for future years with low snow accumulation.

The particles have discrete permittivities that are different from the background medium. The dense-medium model has been applied to the microwave remote sensing of terrestrial snow. In this paper, we propose a different approach of using a bicontinuous medium with discrete permittivities and study the EM scattering properties using analytical and numerical methods. The bicontinuous medium is a continuous representation of interfaces between inhomogeneities within the medium. Discrete permittivities are then assigned to the inhomogeneities of the structure. The analytical approach is based on the Born approximation using the derived analytical correlation functions. The numerical method is based on the numerical Maxwell model of 3-D (NMM3D) approach. In particular, the discrete-dipole approximation and the conjugate gradient-squared method accelerated by the fast Fourier transform technique are used in solving the volume integral equation. Scattering results of analytical and numerical approaches are compared. Numerical results are illustrated using parameters in microwave remote sensing of terrestrial snow. In the NMM3D simulations, three kinds of convergence tests are conducted, viz., convergence with respect to the discretization size, convergence with respect to the sample size, and convergence with respect to the number of realization. The NMM3D results indicate that the scattering by the bicontinuous medium with a broader size distribution has a weaker frequency dependence than that by the medium with a more narrow size distribution. The frequency-dependence power law index can be lower than two, which is very much lower than the power of four in Rayleigh scattering. The NMM3D results also exhibit fairly large cross-polarization returns which account for the local nonisotropic microstructures of bicontinuous media, although the medium is statistically isotropic.}},

These measurements can reduce the number of unknowns in any corresponding higher‐frequency observations that are also affected by the lower boundary condition. The copolarized ratio is sensitive, first of all, to the snow density, which offers the possibility of measuring this parameter directly if a separate measurement of the soil temperature from a passive microwave system is also available. The thermal insulation provided by snow cover can have a powerful effect on the soil‐snow boundary by altering the soil temperature and therefore changing the dielectric contrast.

Bias-correction of the simulated thermal conductivity (relative to field measurements) improved simulated soil temperatures (RMSE = 2.1 °C). Multiple linear regression shows the required correction factor is strongly related to snow depth (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 0.066) particularly early in the winter. Furthermore, CLM simulations did not adequately represent the observed high proportions of depth hoar.

abstract = {{As the Earth warms, the spatial and temporal response of seasonal snow remains uncertain. The global snow science community estimates snow cover and mass with information from land surface models, numerical weather prediction, satellite observations, surface measurements, and combinations thereof. Accurate estimation of snow at the spatial and temporal scales over which snow varies has historically been challenged by the complexity of land cover and terrain and the large global extent of snow-covered regions. Like many Earth science disciplines, snow science is in an era of rapid advances as remote sensing products and models continue to gain granularity and physical fidelity. Despite clear progress, the snow science community continues to face challenges related to the accuracy of seasonal snow estimation. Namely, advances in snow modeling remain limited by uncertainties in modeling parameterization schemes and input forcings, and advances in remote sensing techniques remain limited by temporal, spatial, and technical constraints on the variables that can be observed. Accurate monitoring and modeling of snow improves our ability to assess Earth system conditions, trends, and future projections while serving highly valued global interests in water supply and weather forecasts. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand and improve the errors and uncertainties associated with estimates of snow. A potential method to overcome model and observational shortcomings is data assimilation, which leverages the information content in both observations and models while minimizing their limitations due to uncertainty. This article proposes data assimilation as a way to reduce uncertainties in the characterization of seasonal snow changes and reviews current modeling, remote sensing, and data assimilation techniques applied to the estimation of seasonal snow. Finally, remaining challenges for seasonal snow estimation are discussed.}},

The extension to the Dupuit–Forchheimer coefficient is useful near the snow surface, where Reynolds numbers higher than unity can appear. Simplified semi-empirical models of porous media are also examined. The methodology presented allows for the determination of snow's effective mass transport properties, which are strongly dependent on the snow microstructure and morphology. These effective properties can, in turn, readily be used in snowpack volume-averaged (continuum) models such as strongly layered samples with macroscopically anisotropic properties.}},

The phase dependence was significant (at a significance level of 0.05) for more than 70\% of the fields at HH polarization, its sign corresponding to an increase in optical path upon wetting, and the magnitude of the associated deformation commonly exceeding 2cm for a change in soil moisture of 20\%. This trend was similar in both campaigns, whereas the prevalence of soil moisture-related decorrelation differs. These results are only consistent with a dielectric origin of the soil moisture effects, and not with soil swelling or the penetration depth hypothesis. Changes in vegetation impact the phase depending on the crop and polarization, with the vegetation influence at VV being more pronounced for the agricultural crops present in the study area.}},

Yet today little is known about the temporal evolution of snow permeability as a function of metamorphic regime. Furthermore, our ability to simulate snow permeability over the seasonal evolution of a snowpack has not been tested. Here we have measured the evolution of snow permeability in a subarctic snowpack subject to high temperature-gradient (TG) metamorphism. We have also measured the evolution of the same snowpack deposited over tables so that it evolved in the equi-temperature (ET) regime. Permeability varies in the range 31 × 10−10 (ET regime) to 650 × 10−10 m2 (TG regime). Permeability increases over time in TG conditions and decreases under ET conditions. Using measurements of density ρ and of specific surface area (SSA), from which the equivalent sphere radius r is determined, we show that the equation linking SSA, density ρ and permeability, K = 3.0 r2 e(−0.013 ρ) (with K in m2, r in m and ρ in kg m−3) obtained in a previous study adequately predicts permeability values. The detailed snowpack model Crocus is used to simulate the physical properties of the TG and ET snowpacks. For the most part, all variables are well reproduced. Simulated permeabilities are up to a factor of two greater than measurements for depth hoar layers, which we attribute to snow microstructure and its aerodynamic properties. Finally, the large difference in permeabilities between ET and TG metamorphic regimes will impact atmosphere-snow energy and mass exchanges. These effects deserve consideration in predicting the effect of climate change on snow properties and snow–atmosphere interactions.}},

However, as optical imagery is limited by cloud cover and polar darkness, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) attracted more attention for its ability to sense day-and-night under any cloud and weather condition. In addition to widely applied backscattering-based method, thanks to the advancements of spaceborne SAR sensors and image processing techniques, many new approaches based on interferometric SAR (InSAR) and polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) have been developed since the launch of ERS-1 in 1991 to monitor snow cover under both dry and wet snow conditions. Critical auxiliary data including DEM, land cover information, and local meteorological data have also been explored to aid the snow cover analysis.

In this work we use a recurrent convolutional neural network to estimate snow depth at high spatial resolution (10 m GSD), weekly, and at large scale based on satellite data sources and elevation maps, without the need for measurement stations on the ground. The proposed method achieves unprecedented results for large-scale, high-resolution snow depth mapping. The resulting maps are evaluated over a period of three years against high-fidelity snow depth maps obtained with airborne photogrammetry.

Field measurements of snow and firn density, permeability and microstructure are presented and compared with measurements from previous years. Density and permeability profiles follow similar general patterns from year to year; however, the specifics of the profiles show interannual variation. Field measurements of the diffusion of an inert tracer gas, SF6, through the surface wind pack yields an SF6 diffusion coefficient for the June 2000 surface wind pack at Summit of ∼0.06cm2/s; the tortuosity of the surface wind pack was 0.5. The first direct measurements of interstitial air flow in snow due to natural ventilation in undisturbed snow are presented, for light (3m/s) winds and moderately strong (9m/s) winds in a hoar layer 15cm beneath the surface. The measurements during light winds showed results characteristic of diffusion profiles, while the measurements under strong winds showed evidence of ventilation. The interstitial air flow velocities are consistent with previous modeling results.}},

One disadvantage is the often coarse spatial resolution of tens of kilometers of products retrieved from microwave observations from spaceborne radiometers and scatterometers. This can potentially be overcome by using new high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations from Sentinel-1. However, the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 backscatter to vegetation dynamics, or its use in radiative transfer models, such as the water cloud model, has only been tested at field to regional scale. In this study, we compared the cross-polarization ratio (CR) to vegetation dynamics as observed in microwave-based Vegetation Optical Depth from coarse-scale satellites over Europe. CR was obtained from Sentinel-1 VH and VV backscatter observations at 500 m sampling and resampled to the spatial resolution of VOD from the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) on-board the Metop satellite series. Spatial patterns between median CR and ASCAT VOD correspond to each other and to vegetation patterns over Europe. Analysis of temporal correlation between CR and ASCAT VOD shows that high Pearson correlation coefficients (Rp) are found over croplands and grasslands (median Rp > 0.75). Over deciduous broadleaf forests, negative correlations are found. This is attributed to the effect of structural changes in the vegetation canopy which affect CR and ASCAT VOD in different ways. Additional analysis comparing CR to passive microwave-based VOD shows similar effects in deciduous broadleaf forests and high correlations over crop- and grasslands. Though the relationship between CR and VOD over deciduous forests is unclear, results suggest that CR is useful for monitoring vegetation dynamics over crop- and grassland and a potential path to high-resolution VOD.}},

Most snow stability evaluations are based on field observations, which are time-consuming and sometimes dangerous. Through numerical modelling of the snow cover stratigraphy, the problem of having sparsely measured regional stability information can be overcome. In this study we compared numerical model output with observed stability. Overall, 775 snow profiles combined with Rutschblock scores and release types for the area surrounding five weather stations were rated into three stability classes. Snow stratigraphy data were then produced for the locations of these five weather stations using the snow cover model SNOWPACK. We observed that (i) an existing physically based stability interpretation implemented in SNOWPACK was applicable for regional stability evaluation; (ii) modelled variables equivalent to those manually observed variables found to be significantly discriminatory with regard to stability, did not demonstrated equal strength of classification; (iii) additional modelled variables that cannot be measured in the field discriminated well between stability categories. Finally, with objective feature selection, a set of variables was chosen to establish an optimal link between the modelled snow stratigraphy data and the stability rating through the use of classification trees. Cross-validation was then used to assess the quality of the classification trees. A true skill statistic of 0.5 and 0.4 was achieved by two models that detected “rather stable” or “rather unstable” conditions, respectively. The interpretation derived could be further developed into a support tool for avalanche warning services for the prediction of regional avalanche danger.}},

These 30-arcsec (∼800-m) grids are the official spatial climate data sets of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) interpolation method was used to develop data sets that reflected, as closely as possible, the current state of knowledge of spatial climate patterns in the United States. PRISM calculates a climate–elevation regression for each digital elevation model (DEM) grid cell, and stations entering the regression are assigned weights based primarily on the physiographic similarity of the station to the grid cell. Factors considered are location, elevation, coastal proximity, topographic facet orientation, vertical atmospheric layer, topographic position, and orographic effectiveness of the terrain. Surface stations used in the analysis numbered nearly 13 000 for precipitation and 10 000 for temperature. Station data were spatially quality controlled, and short-period-of-record averages adjusted to better reflect the 1971–2000 period. PRISM interpolation uncertainties were estimated with cross-validation (C-V) mean absolute error (MAE) and the 70\% prediction interval of the climate–elevation regression function. The two measures were not well correlated at the point level, but were similar when averaged over large regions. The PRISM data set was compared with the WorldClim and Daymet spatial climate data sets. The comparison demonstrated that using a relatively dense station data set and the physiographically sensitive PRISM interpolation process resulted in substantially improved climate grids over those of WorldClim and Daymet. The improvement varied, however, depending on the complexity of the region. Mountainous and coastal areas of the western United States, characterized by sparse data coverage, large elevation gradients, rain shadows, inversions, cold air drainage, and coastal effects, showed the greatest improvement. The PRISM data set benefited from a peer review procedure that incorporated local knowledge and data into the development process. Copyright © 2008 Royal Meteorological Society}},

We find hotspots primarily in high-mountain Asia (the Tibetan Plateau), Central Asia, western Russia, western US and the southern Andes.

Under conditions of warming and increasing precipitation that characterizes both observed and projected climate change over much of the NH land area with seasonal snow cover, the sensitivity analysis indicated snow cover duration (SCD) was the snow cover variable exhibiting the strongest climate sensitivity, with sensitivity varying with climate regime and elevation. The highest snow cover–climate sensitivity was found in maritime climates with extensive winter snowfall—for example, the coastal mountains of western North America (NA). Analysis of trends in snow cover duration during the 1966–2007 period of NOAA data showed the largest decreases were concentrated in a zone where seasonal mean air temperatures were in the range of −5° to +5°C that extended around the midlatitudinal coastal margins of the continents. These findings were echoed by the climate models that showed earlier and more widespread decreases in SCD than annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWEmax), with the zone of earliest significant decrease located over the maritime margins of NA and western Europe. The lowest SCD–climate sensitivity was observed in continental interior climates with relatively cold and dry winters, where precipitation plays a greater role in snow cover variability. The sensitivity analysis suggested a potentially complex elevation response of SCD and SWEmax to increasing temperature and precipitation in mountain regions as a result of nonlinear interactions between the duration of the snow season and snow accumulation rates.}},

The design focuses on the forward-looking geometry near the specular direction, which allows a high surface reflectivity, in order to obtain adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with a moderate receiving antenna gain. The sparse array is utilized to sharpen the across-track resolution and reduce the iso-range ambiguity. The formulation for match filtering and illustrations of point target response are presented. This work shows that an array of five to seven receivers is able to achieve an across-track resolution of about 200m in the outer portion of swath and about 1km in the center part of swath. The along-track resolution can reach 10m or better due to the feasibility of a long dwell time for Doppler filtering. We find that the sparse array allows the reduction of the iso-range ambiguity to a level of lower than 5 for a major portion of swath, 70 or greater depending on the number of receivers and spacing. We have completed an SNR formulation, which can consistently account for both coherent and incoherent scattering regardless the spatial resolution. An analysis of SNR based on the Kirchhoff approximation for rough surface scattering has been performed. We find that it is possible to obtain a swath width of 100km with an SNR of 5dB or better for a constellation of seven satellites with a receiving antenna directivity of 15dBi at a LEO altitude of 675km for a wide range of surface roughness. Our study suggests the promise of the SoOpSAR concept for high-resolution remote sensing of land surfaces.}},

We describe the steps used to both triangulate these moving sources, and characterize their spatial errors, using integrated beam forming from two arrays. The two infrasound arrays separated by \textbackslashtextasciitilde103 m and possessing \textbackslashtextasciitilde101.5 m apertures permit efficient triangulation for explosion triggers and moving snow avalanche sources occurring within about 2000 m from the arrays. During the 2018 season, we detect
moving sound sources from hundreds of snow avalanches corresponding to class 1 and 2 avalanches. In many cases we are able to track the sound source(s) traveling down well-known slide paths for more than a kilometer and with speeds up to about 101 m/s, which we consider as a lower bounds on the actual speed of the advancing flow front. Although three arrays were deployed in 2018 and each comprised four infrasonic microphones, we demonstrate that a subset of four sensors (distributed
between two arrays) is especially well suited for quick processing, effective detection, and precise location of the moving avalanche sources. We provide recommendations on the most effective topologies and processing techniques for monitoring avalanche-prone transportation corridors such as

Phase differences of 5-15 deg/10 cm fresh snow were determined at a frequency of 9.65 GHz by comparing spatial and temporal variations of snow depth (SD) with the CPD. Spatial correlations were derived from snow transect measurements during January 2012 and TanDEM-X acquisitions. Temporal correlations were derived from weather station data and TerraSAR-X acquisitions between December 2012 and April 2013. All measurements were done at a test field near the city Sodankylae, Finland. To explain the observed CPD, a model derives birefringent properties from the microstructure of snow, which is described as aligned elliptical particles. The microscopic description is based on computer tomography observations. Different incidence angles were analyzed in consistency with the model. The temporal evolution of the CPD was linked to the temperature-gradient-driven recrystallization process. Sudden increases in the CPD indicate fresh snow. Slow decreases indicate the subsequent recrystallization process. The background signal of wet soil was considered and causes a small negative offset to the CPD. A quantitative determination of the depth of fresh snow is possible, because the specific CPD per meter of snow can be estimated. Spatial resolutions below 100×100 m are achievable with sensors such as TerraSAR-X or TanDEM-X. This paper presents a theoretical relationship between the microstructure of snow and the CPD and relates the CPD theoretically and empirically to the depth of fresh snow.}},

For the 3 years, satellite‐derived estimates captured a decrease in mean April snow depth (∼2.50 cm) and ice thickness (∼0.28 m) equivalent to an ice volume loss of ∼12.5\%. Results show greater thinning of multiyear ice with an end‐of‐season thickness in 2021 that is lower by ∼16.1\% (0.50 m), with negligible changes over first‐year ice. For the period, sea ice thickness estimates using snow depth from climatology result in thicker ice (by up to ∼0.22 m) with a smaller decrease in multiyear ice thickness (∼0.38 m). An 18‐year satellite record, since the launch of ICESat, points to a loss of ∼6,000 km3 or one‐third of the winter Arctic ice volume driven by decline in multiyear‐ice coverage in the multi‐decadal transition to a largely seasonal ice cover. Ice thickness and volume are critical variables for assessing the evolution and response of the polar sea ice cover to a warming climate. Retrieval of sea ice thickness from altimeter freeboards (i.e., the vertical height of the floating ice and snow above the local sea level) requires knowledge of loading due to snow. Until recently, snow depth has been prescribed with a climatology based on historical field records. Using freeboard differences from ICESat‐2 and CryoSat‐2, we are now able to derive snow depth estimates. In this paper we examine the differences between climatological and satellite‐derived snow depth as well as the retrieved ice thicknesses from the two altimeter missions. Their changes for three winters between 2018 and 2021 are documented. Derived ice volume estimates are placed within the context of an 18‐year satellite record.

abstract = {{The main limiting factor on the accuracy of Interferometric SAR measurements (InSAR) comes from phase propagation delays through the troposphere. The delay can be divided into a stratified component, which correlates with the topography and often dominates the tropospheric signal, and a turbulent component. We use Global Atmospheric Models (GAM) to estimate the stratified phase delay and delay-elevation ratio at epochs of SAR acquisitions, and compare them to observed phase delay derived from SAR interferograms. Three test areas are selected with different geographic and climatic environments and with large SAR archive available. The Lake Mead, Nevada, USA is covered by 79 ERS1/2 and ENVISAT acquisitions, the Haiyuan Fault area, Gansu, China, by 24 ERS1/2 acquisitions, and the Afar region, Republic of Djibouti, by 91 Radarsat acquisitions. The hydrostatic and wet stratified delays are computed from GAM as a function of atmospheric pressure P, temperature T, and water vapor partial pressure e vertical profiles. The hydrostatic delay, which depends on ratio P/T, varies significantly at low elevation and cannot be neglected. The wet component of the delay depends mostly on the near surface specific humidity. GAM predicted delay-elevation ratios are in good agreement with the ratios derived from InSAR data away from deforming zones. Both estimations of the delay-elevation ratio can thus be used to perform a first order correction of the observed interferometric phase to retrieve a ground motion signal of low amplitude. We also demonstrate that aliasing of daily and seasonal variations in the stratified delay due to uneven sampling of SAR data significantly bias InSAR data stacks or time series produced after temporal smoothing. In all three test cases, the InSAR data stacks or smoothed time series present a residual stratified delay of the order of the expected deformation signal. In all cases, correcting interferograms from the stratified delay removes all these biases. We quantify the standard error associated with the correction of the stratified atmospheric delay. It varies from one site to another depending on the prevailing atmospheric conditions, but remains bounded by the standard deviation of the daily fluctuations of the stratified delay around the seasonal average. Finally we suggest that the phase delay correction can potentially be improved by introducing a non-linear dependence to the elevation derived from GAM.}},

Average values ranged from 0.078 W m−1 K−1 for new snow to 0.290 W m−1 K−1 for an ubiquitous wind slab. ks increased with increasing density, consistent with published equations, but could also be reliably estimated from the metamorphic state of the snow. Using measured values of ks and snow stratigraphy, the average bulk value for the full snowpack was 0.14 W m−1 K−1. In contrast, ks inferred from ice growth and temperature gradients in the snow was 0.33 W m−1 K−1. The mismatch arises in part because the second estimate is based on measurements from an aggregate scale that includes enhanced heat flow due to two- and three-dimensional snow and ice geometry. A finite element model suggests that the complex geometry produces areas of concentrated heat loss at the snow surface. These “hot spots,” however, increase the apparent conductivity only by a factor of 1.4, not enough to fully explain the mismatch. Nonconductive heat transfer mechanisms, like natural and forced air convection, may also be operating in the snowpack, though the ubiquitous presence of low permeability wind slabs potentially limits their effectiveness. The relative contributions of effects due to snow and ice geometric and nonconductive processes within the snowpack remain uncertain.}},

For the southernmost range (the White Mountains), spring snow at most elevations will disappear by the end of the twenty-first century. We investigate soil and fuel moisture changes for the five mountain ranges and for six lowland regions. The accelerated depletion of mountain snowpack due to warming leads to reduced summer soil moisture across mountain environments. Similarly, warmer and drier summers lead to decreases of up to 25\% in dead fuel moisture across all mountain ranges. Collective declines in spring mountain snowpack, summer soil moisture, and fuel moisture across western mountain ranges will increase fire potential in flammability-limited forested systems where fuels are not limiting. Projected changes in fire potential in predominately fuel-limited systems at lower elevations are more uncertain given the confounding signals between projected changes in soil moisture and fuel moisture.}},

The solar radiation received is determined by direct solar output and the Earth‘s orbital fluctuations, and the albedo is largely determined by changes at the surface and by clouds and particles in the atmosphere. Things that affect the efficiency of infrared energy loss to space include both clouds and certain trace gases that absorb outgoing infrared energy and are commonly called greenhouse gases. In order of global importance to the energy balance, these greenhouse gases include water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), ozone, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), of which CFC-12 dominates, nitrous oxide, and dozens of others. Most of these are long-lived gases, meaning that molecules emitted into the atmosphere tend to remain there for decades and their concentrations are fairly similar throughout the world; important exceptions are water vapor and ozone, which are controlled by a variety of faster processes and therefore have larger variations across the globe and change faster in time.}},

In this paper, the one-dimensional equations governing the heat transfer, water transport, vapour diffusion and mechanical deformation of a phase changing snowpack are stated. New snow, wind drift and snow ablation are treated as special mass boundary conditions. Snow is modelled as a three-component (ice, water, air) porous material capable of undergoing large irreversible viscous deformations. Phase changes between the components are simulated. Snow layers are defined not only in terms of height and density, but also microstructure. That is, by the size, shape and bonding of the grains composing the ice lattice. The governing differential equations are solved using a fully implicit Lagrangian Gauss–Seidel finite-element method. Example calculations from the catastrophic avalanche winter 1999 are presented to document model performance. The overall mass balance evaluation shows that the model accurately predicts the build-up and ablation of the seasonal alpine snowcover.}},

Output is assessed from a 280-yr control simulation that is based on 1990 atmospheric composition and an idealized 140-yr future simulation in which atmospheric carbon dioxide increases at 1\% yr−1 until doubling in year 70 and then remains constant. When compared with a low-resolution model, the high-resolution model is found to better represent the geographic distribution of snow variables in the present climate. In response to idealized radiative forcing changes, both models produce similar global-scale responses in which global-mean temperature and total precipitation increase while snowfall decreases. Zonally, snowfall tends to decrease in the low to midlatitudes and increase in the mid- to high latitudes. At the regional scale, the high- and low-resolution models sometimes diverge in the sign of projected snowfall changes; the high-resolution model exhibits future increases in a few select high-altitude regions, notably the northwestern Himalaya region and small regions in the Andes and southwestern Yukon, Canada. Despite such local signals, there is an almost universal reduction in snowfall as a percent of total precipitation in both models. By using a simple multivariate model, temperature is shown to drive these trends by decreasing snowfall almost everywhere while precipitation increases snowfall in the high altitudes and mid- to high latitudes. Mountainous regions of snowfall increases in the high-resolution model exhibit a unique dominance of the positive contribution from precipitation over temperature.}},

The mapping and documentation of avalanches in Austria is mostly done by experts during field observations and covers usually only specific localized areas. A comprehensive mapping of avalanches is, however, crucial for the work of local avalanche commissions as well as avalanche warning services to assess, e.g., the avalanche danger. Over the past decade, mapping avalanches from satellite imagery has proven to be a promising and rapid approach to monitor avalanche activity in specific regions. Several recent avalanche detection approaches use deep learning-based algorithms to improve detection rates compared to traditional segmentation algorithms. Building on the success of these deep learning-based approaches, we present the first steps to build a modular data pipeline to map historical avalanche cycles in Copernicus Sentinel-1 imagery of the Austrian Alps. The Sentinel-1 mission has provided free all-weather synthetic aperture radar data since 2014, which has proven suitable for avalanche mapping in a Norwegian test area. In addition, we present a roadmap for setting up a segmentation algorithm, in which a general U-Net approach will serve as a baseline and will be compared with the mapping results of additional algorithms initially applied to autonomous driving. We propose to train the U-Net using labeled training dataset of avalanche outlines from Switzerland, Norway and Greenland. Due to the lack of training and validation data from Austria, we plan to compile the first avalanche archive for Austria. Meteorological variables, e.g., precipitation or wind, are highly important for the release of avalanches. In a completely new approach, we will therefore consider weather station data or outputs of numerical weather models in the learning-based algorithm to improve the detection performance. The mapping results in Austria will be complemented with pointwise field measurements of the MOLISENS platform and the RIEGL VZ-6000 terrestrial laser scanner.}},

Using multiple spectral bands rather than band ratios or band indices, retrievals of snow properties that affect its albedo lead to more accurate estimates than widely used age-based models of albedo evolution.

We present the Snow Property Inversion from Remote Sensing (SPIReS) approach, offering the following improvements: 1) Solutions for grain size and concentrations of light absorbing particles are computed simultaneously; 2) Only snow and snow-free endmembers are employed; 3) Cloud-masking and smoothing are integrated; 4) Similar spectra are grouped together and interpolants are used to reduce computation time. The source codes are available in an open repository. Computation is fast enough that users can process imagery on demand. Validation of retrievals from Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) against WorldView-2/3 and the Airborne Snow Observatory shows accurate detection of snow and estimates of fractional snow cover. Validation of albedo shows low errors using terrain-corrected in situ measurements.

abstract = {{This letter describes the concept of using delta-K technique on interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data for deriving the snow water equivalent (SWE) of dry snow-covered ground by utilizing the presence of scatterers in both datasets. The main scattering contribution from a dry snow cover is from the snow–ground interface. Thus, the interferometric phase of two SAR images, one with no snow and one with dry snow cover, contains information on the SWE. By performing a delta-K processing of the two SAR scenes followed by averaging, an estimation of the SWE can be achieved. The first step in the delta-K InSAR processing is to split the band into two nonoverlapping subfrequency band images. The resulting two subband images then contain two new carrier frequencies with a small delta frequency or delta-K separation. The next step is to multiply the two subband images together to obtain the delta-K image, one for summer and one for winter. Finally, the delta-K interferometric SAR image is generated by multiplying the two delta-K images from summer and winter together. In this letter, experimental results using European Remote sensing Satellite 1 (ERS-1) data from a summer and winter situation show that the delta-K phase can be estimated to a few degrees accuracy for an area of 10\$\textbackslash,\textbackslashtimes\textbackslash,\textbackslashhbox \{10\} \textbackslashtextasciitilde\textbackslashhbox \{km\}\textasciicircum\{2\}\$ corresponding to an SWE accuracy of approximately 100 mm.}},

Positive energy fluxes into a snowpack must first satisfy the remaining energy deficit before snowmelt runoff begins, making cold content a key component of the snowpack energy budget. Nevertheless, uncertainty surrounds cold content development and its relationship to snowmelt, likely because of a lack of direct observations. This work clarifies the controls exerted by air temperature, precipitation, and negative energy fluxes on cold content development and quantifies the relationship between cold content and snowmelt timing and rate at daily to seasonal timescales. The analysis presented herein leverages a unique long-term snow pit record along with validated output from the SNOWPACK model forced with 23 water years (1991–2013) of quality controlled, infilled hourly meteorological data from an alpine and subalpine site in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. The results indicated that precipitation exerted the primary control on cold content development at our two sites with snowfall responsible for 84.4 and 73.0 \% of simulated daily gains in the alpine and subalpine, respectively. A negative surface energy balance – primarily driven by sublimation and longwave radiation emission from the snowpack – during days without snowfall provided a secondary pathway for cold content development, and was responsible for the remaining 15.6 and 27.0 \% of cold content additions. Non-zero cold content values were associated with reduced snowmelt rates and delayed snowmelt onset at daily to sub-seasonal timescales, while peak cold content magnitude had no significant relationship to seasonal snowmelt timing. These results suggest that the information provided by cold content observations and/or simulations is most relevant to snowmelt processes at shorter timescales, and may help water resource managers to better predict melt onset and rate.}},

This new reanalysis replaces the ERA‐Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA‐Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3‐hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set‐up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re‐forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA‐Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global‐mean correlation with monthly‐mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low‐frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA‐Interim, MERRA‐2 and JRA‐55 reanalyses. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the ERA5 global reanalysis from 1979 onwards, which is produced at ECMWF as part of the Copernicus Climate Change Service. It provides a detailed record of the three‐dimensional atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves at an hourly temporal resolution. Compared to its predecessor ERA‐Interim, ERA5 has a much‐increased horizontal resolution and benefits from 10 more years of R\&D, which includes an uncertainty estimate from an underlying ensemble of 4D‐Var data assimilation systems.}},

The flow may only be strong enough to disrupt the temperature field for features of wavelengths on the scale of meters or tens of meters at wind speeds of 10 m/s or more. Other possible causes of windpumping have been examined but they do not appear to be as significant. Rapid pressure perturbations due to turbulence produce very little displacement of the air because of the high frequency and low amplitude.

All western U.S. ecoregions showed significant relationships between the timing of PSM and DSD. Changes in the timing of PSM based on warming predicted for the middle and end of the 21st century ranged from 1 to 9 days and from 6 to 17 days among ecoregions, respectively.

In this method, RadarSat-2 InSAR interferometric coherence images are analyzed, adopting snow-covered and snow-free areas obtained from GF-1 satellite observations as the “ground truth.” The analysis results indicate that the coherence in copolarizations is clearly correlated with the underlying surface type and local incidence angle. These two factors, combined with training samples from GF-1 wide field viewer data, were used to build an SVM to classify coherence images in HH polarization. The classification results demonstrate that snow cover extraction using this method can achieve mean accuracies of 83.8\% and 77.5\% in areas with low and high vegetation coverage, respectively. These accuracies are significantly higher than those achieved by the typical thresholding algorithm (72.7\% and 69.2\%, respectively).}},

It has been suggested that the use of L-band SAR may alleviate this concern given increased penetration depths at longer wavelengths; however, this has not been thoroughly assessed. Here the separability of FYI and MYI is compared using horizontally polarized (HH) C-band (RADARSAT-2) and L-band (ALOS/PALSAR) ScanSAR images acquired over landfast sea ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago in the spring and summer of 2009. L-band provided enhanced contrast between FYI and MYI during early melt onset and during the drainage phase of advanced melt, while C-band was found to provide enhanced contrast when the wet snowpack was transitioning from the pendular regime to the funicular regime. At the time of the pendular–funicular transition, the backscatter signatures of FYI and MYI reversed at both C- and L-band. This behavior is well established at C-band, but has not been reported previously at L-band. The L-band imagery also provided improved definition of floe boundaries and ridges throughout the melt season. Finally, the L-band data had reduced speckle (equivalent number of looks \textbackslashtextasciitilde12), relative to the C-band data (\textbackslashtextasciitilde9 equivalent looks). These results indicate that L-band SAR data acquired during the melt season could be used to enhance operational and scientific sea ice information products that have traditionally been derived from single-frequency C-band SAR data.}},

Thus, only small changes in the snow properties between two interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images will change the interferometric phase. This phase change is shown to introduce a significantly increase in the digital elevation model (DEM) height error, although no effects are observed on the degree of coherence. The phase change is also shown to affect the differential interferometric results and may wrongly be interpreted as range displacement. The presented theory and results implies that light snowfall and/or small changes in snow properties between interferometric SAR (InSAR) image acquisitions, may introduce significant height errors in DEM derived from glaciers, ice sheets, or bare ground, even in the case of high degree of coherence. Thus, meteorological observations in addition to degree of coherence must be considered when generating DEM in areas covered with snow or where snow fall is likely to have occurred.}},

Several automated or semi-automated detection technologies have been developed in the past among which infrasound-based detection is the most promising for regional-scale avalanche monitoring. However, due to significant ambient noise content in infrasonic signals, e.g. from atmospheric processes or airplanes, fully automated and reliable avalanche detection has been very challenging. Signal processing is highly critical and strongly affects detection accuracy. Here, a robust detection method by using supervised machine learning is introduced. Machine learning algorithms can take into account multiple signal features and statistically optimize the classification task. We analyzed infrasound data with concurrent visual avalanche observations from the test site Lavin (Eastern Swiss Alps) for the winter of 2011–2012. A support vector machine was trained by using training data from the first half of the winter season and the accuracy was tested on data from the second half of the season. A significant reduction of false detections, from 65\% to 10\%, was achieved compared to a threshold-based classifier provided by the sensor manufacturer. The proposed method enables reliable assessment of the avalanche activity in the surroundings of the system and paves the way towards robust and fully automated avalanche detection using infrasonic systems.}},

A new multilayer snow scheme is implemented in the European Centre for Medium‐range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System and its impact on snow and 2‐m temperature forecasts is evaluated. The new snow scheme is evaluated offline at well‐instrumented field sites and compared to the current single‐layer scheme. The new scheme largely improves the representation of snow depth for most of the sites considered, reducing the root‐mean‐square error averaged over all sites by more than 30\%. The improvements are due to a better description of snow density in thick and cold snowpacks, but also due to an improved representation of sporadic melting episodes because of the inclusion of a thin top snow layer with a low thermal inertia. The evaluation of coupled 10‐day weather forecasts shows an improved representation of snow depth at all lead times, demonstrating a positive impact at the global scale. Regarding the impact on weather parameters, the multilayer snow scheme improves the simulated minimum 2‐m temperature, by decreasing the positive bias and improving the amplitude of the diurnal cycle over snow‐covered regions. However, the increased variability of the 2‐m temperature can have a detrimental impact in regions characterized by preexisting errors in the daily mean temperature, associated with errors in cloud processes or surface albedo.

We examine trends in snow water equivalent (SWE) using passive microwave data (1987 to 2009). We find an overall decrease in SWE in HMA, despite regions of increased SWE in the Pamir, Kunlun Shan, Eastern Himalaya, and Eastern Tien Shan. Although the average decline in annual SWE across HMA (contributing area, 2641 × 103 km2) is low (average, −0.3\%), annual SWE losses conceal distinct seasonal and spatial heterogeneities across the study region. For example, the Tien Shan has seen both strong increases in winter SWE and sharp declines in spring and summer SWE. In the majority of catchments, the most negative SWE trends are found in mid-elevation zones, which often correspond to the regions of highest snow-water storage and are somewhat distinct from glaciated areas. Negative changes in SWE storage in these mid-elevation zones have strong implications for downstream water availability.}},

Although regional hydrologic changes have been observed (for example, refs 1, 3, 4, 5), the time of emergence of extreme changes in snow accumulation and melt remains a key unknown for assessing climate-change impacts3,6,7.

The occurrence of extremely low snow years becomes widespread by the late twenty-first century, as do the occurrences of extremely high early-season snowmelt and runoff (implying increasing flood risk), and extremely low late-season snowmelt and runoff (implying increasing water stress). Our results suggest that many snow-dependent regions of the Northern Hemisphere are likely to experience increasing stress from low snow years within the next three decades, and from extreme changes in snow-dominated water resources if global warming exceeds 2 °C above the pre-industrial baseline.}},

Snow depth derived from ATL06 data only (snow-on and snow-off) offers a poor temporal and spatial coverage, limiting its potential utility. However, using a digital terrain model from airborne lidar surveys as the snow-off elevation source yielded a snow depth accuracy of ∼ 0.2 m (bias) and precision of ∼ 1 m (random error) across the basin, with an improved precision of 0.5 m for low slopes (< 10∘), compared to eight reference airborne lidar snow depth maps. Snow depths derived from ICESat-2 ATL06 and a satellite photogrammetry digital elevation model have a larger bias and reduced precision, partly induced by increased errors in forested areas. These various combinations of repeated ICESat-2 snow surface elevation measurements with satellite or airborne products will enable tailored approaches to map snow depth and estimate water resource availability in mountainous areas with limited snow depth observations.}},

The dense media are computer-generated by applying the bicontinuous random media characterization. The microstructure of the media is controlled by two parameters: mean grain size \$\textbackslashlangle \textbackslashzeta \textbackslashrangle \$ and aggregation parameter \$\{b\}\$ . Phase matrices and extinction coefficients are computed with full-wave simulations. These are then substituted into radiative transfer (RT) equations to obtain backscattering coefficients of the dense media layer with particle clusters. The backscattering has a weaker frequency dependence (e.g., \$\textbackslashsim \$ 2.6 power for \$\{b\}=\textbackslashmathbf \{0\}.\textbackslashmathbf \{4\}\$ ) than the Rayleigh scattering of fourth power. Backscattering results exhibit strong co-, cross-polarization (pol), and ratio of cross- to co-polarization. For applications to remote sensing of terrestrial snow at C-band, the results of DMRT simulations show that cross-polarization of snow volume scattering can be larger than that of soil surface scattering. Recently, this property of strong cross-polarization has become a useful satellite remote sensing technique for global retrieval of snow depth. Comparisons of DMRT results are made with ESA Satellite Sentinel 1 C-band data and ground-based radar observations. The calculated backscatter is in good agreement with radar measurements for both the co- and cross-polarization.}},

We may wish to characterize the effects of clouds or water droplets along the line of sight between an airplane and a radar installation, or we may be interested in using radar to probe the random medium itself, such as in determining snow depth and particle size. In all of these problems it is necessary to predict the propagation constant in the "random" medium. The purpose of this paper is to characterize the accuracy of the quasi-crystalline approximation and other associated methods of determining the effective permittivity for two-dimensional (2-D) random media. A numerical method based on the method of moments is used as a gauge for comparison with the theoretical methods. After deriving the 2-D quasi-crystalline approximation and presenting the numerical method, the behavior of the effective permittivity is analyzed for a range of particle sizes, volume fractions and dielectric losses. From this analysis, regions of validity for the theoretical methods are determined. An investigation is also given which explores the effect of particle arrangement methods on the pair distribution function which, in turn, is shown to have a significant effect on the imaginary component of the effective permittivity.}},

abstract = {{In the 1998‐1999 winter, the operational feasibility of using RADARSAT SAR data to estimate the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) in a large hydroelectric complex managed by Hydro‐Québec (La Grande River watershed) has been successfully demonstrated. This watershed is located in the subarctic climatic region in the north‐west of the Québec province. The vegetation consists of moderately dense to open Black Spruce forests, open lands, burned lands and peat bogs. In the last few years, an original approach well adapted for this region has been developed to estimate the SWE from SAR data (ERS‐1, RADARSAT). This approach is based on the fact that the snow cover characteristics influence the underlying soil temperature which influences the dielectric properties of the soil and then the recorded backscattering signal. Then, a linear relationship between the backscattering ratios of a winter image and a snow‐free (fall) image, and the snowpack thermal resistance (thermal insulation properties) has been established. Consequently, the algorithm infers the SWE from the estimated thermal resistance and the measured mean density of the snowpack. This algorithm has been implemented within a MapInfo™ application that has been named EQeau. It allows mapping of the spatial distribution of the estimated SWE at the desired level (pixel, square grid, sub‐watershed). During the 1998‐1999 winter, EQeau has been used successfully in a pre‐operational mode using calibrated Wide beam images (W1) from RADARSAT. The algorithm has given mean estimated SWE values similar to the SWE values derived from Hydro‐Quebec snow transects (relative difference between 1\% and 13\%). Also, the SWE increase measured from January to March 1999 is clearly detected on the maps covering almost 77 000 km2. The next steps will be the evaluation of the ScanSAR images and the demonstration of the economical advantages of using RADARSAT data in a hydrological forecasting system.

The release of NLCD 2016 provides important new information on land change patterns across CONUS from 2001 to 2016. For land cover, seven epochs were concurrently generated for years 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2013, and 2016. Products reveal that land cover change is significant across most land cover classes and time periods. The land cover product was validated using existing reference data from the legacy NLCD 2011 accuracy assessment, applied to the 2011 epoch of the NLCD 2016 product line. The legacy and new NLCD 2011 overall accuracies were 82\% and 83\%, respectively, (standard error (SE) was 0.5\%), demonstrating a small but significant increase in overall accuracy. Between 2001 and 2016, the CONUS landscape experienced significant change, with almost 8\% of the landscape having experienced a land cover change at least once during this period. Nearly 50\% of that change involves forest, driven by change agents of harvest, fire, disease and pests that resulted in an overall forest decline, including increasing fragmentation and loss of interior forest. Agricultural change represented 15.9\% of the change, with total agricultural spatial extent showing only a slight increase of 4778 km2, however there was a substantial decline (7.94\%) in pasture/hay during this time, transitioning mostly to cultivated crop. Water and wetland change comprised 15.2\% of change and represent highly dynamic land cover classes from epoch to epoch, heavily influenced by precipitation. Grass and shrub change comprise 14.5\% of the total change, with most change resulting from fire. Developed change was the most persistent and permanent land change increase adding almost 29,000 km2 over 15 years (5.6\% of total CONUS change), with southern states exhibiting expansion much faster than most of the northern states. Temporal rates of developed change increased in 2001–2006 at twice the rate of 2011–2016, reflecting a slowdown in CONUS economic activity. Future NLCD plans include increasing monitoring frequency, reducing latency time between satellite imaging and product delivery, improving accuracy and expanding the variety of products available in an integrated database.}},

New measurements of with improved accuracy were made with a specially designed resonator operating near 1 GHz. The coaxial sensor accurately defines the sample volume whose actual mass can be determined to give the density of the snow sample. A special electronic instrument, called a resometer, enabled accurate and rapid measurements under field conditions. Some 90 measurements of different kinds of dry snow (fresh, old, wind-pressed snow, depth hear, and refrozen crusts) were made at test sites in the Swiss and Austrian Alps. The data indicate that /spl epsiv/ is a function of snow density only, given that the standard deviation of 0.006 from the fitted curve is just due to the expected measurement errors. The interpretation of these data in terms of physical mixing theory favors the effective medium formula of Polder and van Santen (1946). The data allow to relate the average axial ratio X as a function of ice volume fraction. Both prolate and oblate spheroids can explain the data. Independent reasoning gives preference to oblate particles. In both cases, the axial ratio increases with increasing fraction up to a critical value of 0.33, followed by a decrease at still higher fractions. The destructive metamorphism of slowly compacting snow explains the increase of X, while the following decrease might be due to sintering. So far, no effect on /spl epsiv/ by a liquid-like surface layer on the ice grains at temperatures between -10/spl deg/C and 0/spl deg/C has been observed.}},

Three significant problems have been identified: a) problems with the loss of higher frequency signal components in the primary monitoring passband, b) detection problems associated with a low degree of signal coherence between array elements and c) problems with high levels of wind-generated background noise. Loss of higher frequency signal components normally occurs when signal propagation is restricted to a thermospheric waveguide. This problem can often be resolved by ensuring that routine processing algorithms include a long-period passband. Coherence studies show that detection capability for regional and distant explosions may be limited by the small degree of signal correlation between array elements. This problem can be resolved by modifications to the array configuration. Wind-generated background noise is a potentially serious problem at most infrasound monitoring stations. We have developed a new wind-noise-reducing system that effectively eliminates wind-generated noise in the monitoring passband. This system is based on the use of a closed screened enclosure that mechanically degrades turbulent eddies in the atmospheric boundary layer. This system can be used as an effective, stand-alone wind-noise-reducing system that does not require the use of a pipe array.}},

Consequently, snow storage is expected to decrease, which, together with changes in snowmelt rates and timing, might cause reductions in spring and summer low flows. The objectives of this study were (1) to simulate the effect of changing snow storage on low flows during the warm seasons and (2) to relate drought sensitivity to the simulated snow storage changes at different elevations. The Swiss Climate Change Scenarios 2011 data set was used to derive future changes in air temperature and precipitation. A typical bucket‐type catchment model, HBV‐light, was applied to 14 mountain catchments in Switzerland to simulate streamflow and snow in the reference period and three future periods. The largest relative decrease in annual maximum SWE was simulated for elevations below 2,200 m a.s.l. (60–75\% for the period 2070–2099) and the snowmelt season shifted by up to 4 weeks earlier. The relative decrease in spring and summer minimum runoff that was caused by the relative decrease in maximum SWE (i.e., elasticity), reached 40–90\% in most of catchments for the reference period and decreased for the future periods. This decreasing elasticity indicated that the effect of snow on summer low flows is reduced in the future. The fraction of snowmelt runoff in summer decreased by more than 50\% at the highest elevations and almost disappeared at the lowest elevations. This might have large implications on water availability during the summer. In snow‐dominated areas, summer low flows will significantly decrease in the future This decrease will be caused mostly by the decrease in snow storage and the shift of snowmelt season due to the increase in air temperature Low flows at higher elevations are more sensitive to the decrease in snow storage than low flows at lower elevations}},

Methods to detect global snow cover are well advanced and have been applied routinely at local, regional, and global scales. Current snow cover retrieval methods tend to underestimate snow volume because important fractional forest cover and snowpack physical properties are not well parameterized in simple snow parameter retrieval schemes. Building on a static approach to snow depth retrieval, a spatially dynamic algorithm is described that incorporates information about fractional forest cover and snowpack physical development. SSM/I brightness temperatures of land surfaces are calibrated with ground measurements of snow depth through empirical statistical and geostatistical models to produce globally distributed snow depth estimates. The calibration is based on a 4‐year and a one winter season record of daily snow depth and SSM/I observations. The biasing effect of forest cover on microwave estimates is quantified and short‐term fluctuations of microwave‐estimated snow depth (caused by physical changes in the pack) are reduced by time smoothing daily estimated snow depth values. For the data sets used the estimated snow depth from the new algorithm gives global seasonal errors of 13.7 and 22.1 cm for the two data sets. Further major improvements in snow depth retrieval methods will only be achieved through enhancements to forest and snow metamorphism parameterizations.}},

The sensor features a low-noise, 2.02-mPa rms (0.5–2 Hz), 5.47-mPa rms (0.1–20 Hz), or 5.62-mPa rms (0.05–20 Hz), flat response between 0.01 and at least 40 Hz; inband sensitivity of 45.13 ± 0.23 μV Pa−1; and a nominal linear range from −124.5 to +124.5 Pa. Intended for outdoor applications, the influence of thermal changes in the sensor’s response has been minimized by using a thermal compensated pressure transducer powered by an ultralow drift (<5 ppm °C−1) and noise (<4μV from peak to peak) voltage reference. The sensor consumes a minimum of 24 mW and operates with voltages above 8 V while drawing 3 mA of current. The Infra-NMT specifications described above were independently verified using the infrasound test chamber at the Sandia National Laboratories’ (SNL’s) Facility for Acceptance, Calibration, and Testing (FACT), and the following procedures are for comparison calibration against traceable reference stands in voltage and pressure. Because of the intended broad frequency response of this sensor, the testing chamber was configured in a double-reference sensor scheme. A well-characterized microbarometer (with a flat-amplitude response between 0.01 and 8 Hz) and a microphone (with a flat-amplitude response above 8 Hz) were used simultaneously in this double-reference test configuration.}},

Infrasound array processing is used to identify the arrival of seismic‐to‐atmospheric coupled phases and as much as 90 s of infrasound coda. Apparent velocities ranging from seismic speeds to subhorizontal atmospheric sound speeds are attributed to a superposition of coincident waves arriving at the arrays. We find that the arriving infrasound originates from a broad range of back azimuths that deviates from epicentral back azimuth and indicates the ubiquity of secondary radiators for this relatively small earthquake. Secondary radiators, which often locate in regions of elevated topography, are identified using backprojections and earthquake initiation time. Analysis of infrasound sources from proximal earthquakes can be used to map ground shaking distributions, which are important for assessment of earthquake hazards. Earthquakes are known to produce sounds, which encompass frequencies that are both perceptible and below the threshold of human hearing. Low frequency earthquake (infra)sound may be recorded with specialized microphones to understand how earthquakes shake Earth's surface. Our study uses six infrasonic microphone stations to detect and locate sound sources for a magnitude 3.6 earthquake that occurred within 25 km of the stations. The recorded infrasound is produced by ground shaking at both the infrasound stations and also over a wide distribution of areas coinciding with mountain topography. These secondary sources of earthquake sounds occur as seismic waves pass by and the resultant ground shaking perturbs the atmosphere. The identification of infrasound in this study is possible even though the earthquake size is relatively small. A network of arrays is used to locate proximal infrasound sources for a M3.6 Idaho earthquake “Local infrasound” (at recording site) and “secondary infrasound” (from the epicentral region and from elevated topography) are identified Intermediate slowness values are common and are attributed to superposition of subhorizontal and subvertical propagating infrasound}},

In this work, the local SNR-based Goldstein filter is further developed with the improvements in the definition of the local SNR and the adaption of the filtering patch size. What’s more, for preventing the loss of the phase signal caused by the excessive filtering, an iteration filtering operation is also introduced in this new algorithm. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, both a simulated digital elevation model (DEM) interferogram and real SAR deformation interferogram spanning the L’ Aquila earthquake are carried out. The quantitative results from the simulated and real data reveal that up to 79.5\% noises can be reduced by the new filter, indicating 9\%–32\% improvements over the previous local SNR-based Goldstein filter. This demonstrates that the new filter is not only equipped with sufficient adaption, but also can suppress the phase noise without the sacrifice of the phase signal.}},

Winter soil CO2 fluxes can be surprisingly variable, owing to physical factors such as snowpack properties and wind. This study aimed to quantify the effects of advective transport of CO2 in soil–snow systems on the subdiurnal to diurnal (hours to days) timescale, use an enhanced diffusion model to replicate the effects of CO2 concentration depletions from persistent winds, and use a model–measure pairing to effectively explore what is happening in the field. We took continuous measurements of CO2 concentration gradients and meteorological data at a site in the Cape Breton Highlands of Nova Scotia, Canada, to determine the relationship between wind speeds and CO2 levels in snowpacks. We adapted a soil CO2 diffusion model for the soil–snow system and simulated stepwise changes in transport rate over a broad range of plausible synthetic cases. The goal was to mimic the changes we observed in CO2 snowpack concentration to help elucidate the mechanisms (diffusion, advection) responsible for observed variations. On subdiurnal to diurnal timescales with varying winds and constant snow levels, a strong negative relationship between wind speed and CO2 concentration within the snowpack was often identified. Modelling clearly demonstrated that diffusion alone was unable to replicate the high-frequency CO2 fluctuations, but simulations using above-atmospheric snowpack diffusivities (simulating advective transport within the snowpack) reproduced snow CO2 changes of the observed magnitude and speed. This confirmed that wind-induced ventilation contributed to episodic pulsed emissions from the snow surface and to suppressed snowpack concentrations. This study improves our understanding of winter CO2 dynamics to aid in continued quantification of the annual global C cycle and demonstrates a preference for continuous wintertime CO2 flux measurement systems.}},

Direct determination of snow thermal diffusivity requires coupled point measurements of thermal conductivity and density, which continually change due to snow metamorphism. Traditional methods for determining these two quantities are generally limited by temporal resolution. In this study we present a method to determine the thermal diffusivity of snow with high temporal resolution using snow temperature profile measurements. High resolution (between 2.5 and 10cm at 1min) temperature measurements from the seasonal snow pack at the Plaine-Morte glacier in Switzerland are used as initial conditions and Neumann (heat flux) boundary conditions to numerically solve the one-dimensional heat equation and iteratively optimize for thermal diffusivity. The implementation of Neumann boundary conditions and a t-test, ensuring statistical significance between solutions of varied thermal diffusivity, are important to help constrain thermal diffusivity such that spurious high and low values as seen with Dirichlet (temperature) boundary conditions are reduced. The results show that time resolved thermal diffusivity can be determined from temperature measurements of seasonal snow and support density-based empirical parameterizations for thermal conductivity.}},

In this paper, the macroscopic equivalent modeling of heat and water vapor transfers through a snow layer was derived from the physics at the pore scale using the homogenization of multiple scale expansions. The microscopic phenomena under consideration are heat conduction, vapor diffusion, sublimation, and deposition. The obtained macroscopic equivalent model is described by two coupled transient diffusion equations including a source term arising from phase change at the pore scale. By dimensional analysis, it was shown that the influence of such source terms on the overall transfers can generally not be neglected, except typically under small temperature gradients. The precision and the robustness of the proposed macroscopic modeling were illustrated through 2D numerical simulations. Finally, the effective vapor diffusion tensor arising in the macroscopic modeling was computed on 3D images of snow. The self-consistent formula offers a good estimate of the effective diffusion coefficient with respect to the snow density, within an average relative error of 10\%. Our results confirm recent work that the effective vapor diffusion is not enhanced in snow.}},

In this study, a one-dimensional finite-element numerical model was developed to analyze the influence of individual snow-specific and climatic factors on the ground thermal regime. The results indicate that the most important factor is snow depth. Snow depths below the threshold value of 0.6 m lack sufficient insulation to prevent low atmospheric temperatures from cooling the soil. The date of first winter snow insulation and variations in mean annual air temperature (MAAT) are also shown to be important. Delays in early-winter snow insulation and in summer snow disappearance are shown to be of approximately equal significance to the ground thermal conditions. Numerical modelling also indicates that the duration of effective thermal resistance of snow cover governs the slope of the linear dependency between MAAT and mean annual ground surface temperatures (MAGST). Consequently, the most direct effect of a long-term rise in air temperatures on ground temperatures is predicted under a thin snow cover with early snowmelt in spring and/or where a large change in the date of total snowmelt occurs, in response to atmospheric warming.}},

These products are used extensively in hydrological modeling and climate studies. Reprocessing of the complete snow-cover data record, from Collection 5 (C5) to Collection 6 (C6) and Collection 6.1 (C6.1), has provided improvements in the MODIS product suite. Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Collection 1 (C1) snow-cover products at a 375 m spatial resolution have been available since 2011 and are currently being reprocessed for Collection 2 (C2). Both the MODIS C6.1 and the VIIRS C2 products will be available for download from the National Snow and Ice Data Center beginning in early 2020 with the complete time series available in 2020. To address the need for a cloud-reduced or cloud-free daily SCE product for both MODIS and VIIRS, a daily cloud-gap-filled (CGF) snow-cover algorithm was developed for MODIS C6.1 and VIIRS C2 processing. MOD10A1F (Terra) and MYD10A1F (Aqua) are daily, 500 m resolution CGF SCE map products from MODIS. VNP10A1F is the daily, 375 m resolution CGF SCE map product from VIIRS. These CGF products include quality-assurance data such as cloud-persistence statistics showing the age of the observation in each pixel. The objective of this paper is to introduce the new MODIS and VIIRS standard CGF daily SCE products and to provide a preliminary evaluation of uncertainties in the gap-filling methodology so that the products can be used as the basis for a moderate-resolution Earth science data record (ESDR) of SCE. Time series of the MODIS and VIIRS CGF products have been developed and evaluated at selected study sites in the US and southern Canada. Observed differences, although small, are largely attributed to cloud masking and differences in the time of day of image acquisition. A nearly 3-month time-series comparison of Terra MODIS and S-NPP VIIRS CGF snow-cover maps for a large study area covering all or parts of 11 states in the western US and part of southwestern Canada reveals excellent correspondence between the Terra MODIS and S-NPP VIIRS products, with a mean difference of 11 070 km2, which is ∼0.45 \% of the study area. According to our preliminary validation of the Terra and Aqua MODIS CGF SCE products in the western US study area, we found higher accuracy of the Terra product compared with the Aqua product. The MODIS CGF SCE data record beginning in 2000 has been extended into the VIIRS era, which should last at least through the early 2030s.}},

A surface-based C-band polarimetric data set collected in February 2006 is used to contrast the polarimetric response to sampled conditions of bare frozen ground, cold snow-covered ground, and snow during a Chinook event. Chinook activity is inherently spatially and temporally variable across the region in winter and produces considerable spatial variability of snow-cover physical properties associated with snow–water-equivalent (SWE) estimates. A temporal analysis of polarimetric backscatter sensed during a Chinook-induced ablation event on February 27, 2006 is used to describe the associated changes in snow conditions and scattering mechanisms. Analysis reveals that the polarimetric surface-based C-band scatterometer data respond to changes in snow parameters associated with the specific ground and snow conditions and to the temporal Chinook ablation event. Use of the copolarizations, cross-polarization, depolarization ratio, copolarization ratio, complex copolarization correlation coefficient, and the copolarized phase difference information show promise in describing changes in snow physical parameters, differing ground and snow conditions, and transitional ablation events, based on differing scattering mechanisms. This paper infers that an increase in volume scattering and fluctuations in surface scattering during the Chinook ablation event may be associated with specific physical changes such as density, crystal structure, and permittivity caused by wind speed. This paper has implications for remotely sensed estimations of snow-covered area (SCA) and SWE. Association of SCA and SWE with backscatter coefficients is not explicit in this paper; however, changes in SWE and snow properties are inferentially linked to changes in backscatter.}},

Backscattering coefficients from 1 to 40 GHz, in situ snow–ground SPs, and meteorological data are measured at the Davos-Laret Remote Sensing Field Laboratory (Switzerland). Relative strengths of the snow–ground system’s three primary scattering elements (air–snow interface, snow volume, and snow–ground interface) on backscattering are assessed. An anticorrelation between reasonably high snow wetness and backscattering coefficient is found, especially at higher microwave frequencies. For small amounts of snow wetness, backscatter coefficients at L- and S-bands are intensified via increasing snow volume and snow surface scattering. Snow–ground SPs influence backscattering according to their characteristic time scales of temporal evolution. Under dry snow conditions and at low and intermediate frequencies, ground permittivity is the major influencer of backscatter at a time scale of roughly two weeks. Snowfall is the major influencer of backscatter at a time scale of a few hours to a few days. The findings of this article are valuable to the development of retrieval algorithms using machine learning while maintaining a grasp on the ongoing physical processes. Another key message is that multifrequency active microwave measurements are critical to maximize the number of retrievable SPs and their estimation accuracy. For example, while Ka-band performs well in the detection of snow cover, L-band measurements are more responsive to changes of snow water equivalent (SWE) under moist or wet snow conditions.}},

The new data set has a higher mean value of density but a lower mean value of thermal conductivity than the old set.

Interforometric SAR (InSAR) capabilities are also discussed, and as a example, the coherence of subsequent SAR acquisitions over the observed boreal forest stand are analyzed over increasing temporal baselines. The analysis shows good conservation of coherence in particular at L-band, while higher frequencies are susceptible to loss of coherence in particular for dense vegetation. The potential of the instrument for satellite calibration and validation activities is also discussed.}},

We present a possible mechanism linking snowmelt rate and streamflow generation using a gridded implementation of the Budyko framework. We computed an ensemble of Budyko streamflow anomalies (BSAs) using Variable Infiltration Capacity model‐simulated evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration, and estimated precipitation at 1/16° resolution from 1950 to 2013. BSA was correlated with simulated baseflow efficiency (r2 = 0.64) and simulated snowmelt rate (r2 = 0.42). The strong correlation between snowmelt rate and baseflow efficiency (r2 = 0.73) links these relationships and supports a possible streamflow generation mechanism wherein greater snowmelt rates increase subsurface flow. Rapid snowmelt may thus bring the soil to field capacity, facilitating below‐root zone percolation, streamflow, and a positive BSA. Previous works have shown that future increases in regional air temperature may lead to earlier, slower snowmelt and hence decreased streamflow production via the mechanism proposed by this work. Snowmelt rate drives subsurface flow and streamflow production across the western U.S. Western U.S. ecoregions have varying streamflow sensitivities to changes in snowmelt rate Earlier, slower snowmelt usually produces less streamflow than more rapid melt}},

It is therefore important to correctly model snow surface temperatures in energy balance snowmelt models. This paper focuses on the relationship between snow surface temperature and conductive energy fluxes that drive the energy balance of a snowpack. Time series of snow temperature at the surface and through the snowpack were measured to examine energy conduction in a snowpack. Based on these measurements we calculated the snowpack energy content and conductive energy flux at the snow surface. We then used these estimates of conductive energy flux to evaluate formulae for the calculation of the conductive flux at the snow surface based on surface temperature time series. We use a method based on Fourier frequency analysis to estimate snow thermal properties. Among the formulae evaluated, we found that a modified force-restore formula, based on the superimposition of the force-restore equation capturing diurnal fluctuations on a gradually changing temperature gradient, had the best agreement with observations of heat conduction. This formula is suggested for the parameterization of snow surface temperature in a full snowpack energy balance model.}},

This paper derives an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) scattering model for dense media, such as snow, which takes into account multiple scattering effects through the Quasi‐Crystalline Approximation. The result of this derivation is a simplified version of the InSAR correlation model derived for relating the InSAR correlation measurements to the snowpack characteristics of grain size, volume fraction, and layer depth as well as those aspects of the volume‐ground interaction that affects the interferometric observation (i.e., the surface topography and the ratio of ground‐to‐volume scattering). Based on the model, the sensitivity of the InSAR correlation measurements to the snow characteristics is explored by simulation. Through this process, it is shown that Ka‐band InSAR phase has a good sensitivity to snow grain size and volume fraction, while for lower frequency signals (Ku‐band to L‐band), the InSAR correlation magnitude and phase have a sensitivity to snow depth. Since the formulation depends, in part, on the pair distribution function, three functional forms of the pair distribution function are implemented and their effects on InSAR phase measurements compared. The InSAR scattering model described in this paper is intended to be an observational prototype for future Ka‐band and L‐band InSAR missions, such as NASA's Surface Water and Ocean Topography and NASA‐ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar missions, planned for launch in the 2020–2021 time frame. This formulation also enables further investigation of the InSAR‐based snow retrieval approaches.

We indirectly characterized the variation in snow grain size using the daily profiles of the temperature gradient within the snowpack. In addition, a zoning and multitemporal modeling strategy was employed to reduce the bias and uncertainty caused by snow heterogeneity across different ecoregions and seasons.

abstract = {{Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing is a state-of-the-art tool for snow monitoring and snow parameters estimation. SAR remote sensing-based techniques, such as interferometric SAR (InSAR) and Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) have already proven useful in the estimation of geophysical parameters of snow. InSAR-based techniques utilize interferometric phase information from repeat-pass datasets for snow parameters retrieval. During the monitoring of snow, the large temporal gap between the repeat passes results in the temporal decorrelation in the snowpack, which leads to the loss of interferometric coherence. Hence, there is a need for a technique for snow parameters estimation, which can work with zero temporal baseline datasets. This study works on the development of a Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (PolInSAR) based modelling approach for snow-depth estimation using TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X datasets acquired in the pursuit monostatic mode (temporal baseline = 10 seconds). The study area of this work is the Manali region of Himachal Pradesh situated in the Beas basin. Multi-temporal analysis of the snow-depth variation is executed utilizing the two pursuit-monostatic TanDEM-X interferometric quad-pol dataset pairs of the dates 21 January 2015 and 22 January 2015. In this study, the PolInSAR-based Coherence Amplitude Inversion modelling approach is used for the snow-depth retrieval. The magnitude of the complex interferometric coherence is used during the modelling implementation. The snow extinction coefficient is estimated and used as an input during PolInSAR modelling. Further, a comparison of the calculated volume coherence magnitude and the observed volume coherence magnitude is done during model implementation for the snow-depth estimation. The snow depth is estimated at a resolution of 15 m × 15 m in range and azimuth directions respectively. The estimated snow depth for both the dates shows a precise correlation with the ground datasets. The rise in model retrieved snow-depth value from 0.84 m to 1.24 m is observed during the period. The retrieved results were validated using the ground data of snow depth from the Automatic weather station (AWS) of Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE), Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), and Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS) installed in the Dhundi region of the study area for same dates.}},

In this paper, the characteristics of C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in an area of shallow dry snow cover were analyzed based on microwave backscattering models and field snow cover measurements. The analysis revealed that the backscattering of shallow dry snow cover was dominated by the scattering of the snow-ground interface, and the dielectric constant and roughness parameters of the underlying frozen soil were the primary factors that affected the total scattering. The dielectric constant of the soil depended on the amount of liquid water present in the soil, and the amount of liquid water was primarily determined by the soil temperature. Furthermore, the insulation properties (thermal resistance) of the snow cover affected the underlying soil temperature. Consequently, the snow cover characteristics affected the backscattering signal recorded by the SAR sensors. Based on an investigation involving ENVISAT-ASAR data and simultaneous ground-based snow observations conducted on 14 March 2008, we found that the snow temperature decreased with increasing snow depth when the snow depth was less than 20 cm, and the temperature increased with decreasing snow depth when the snow depth exceeded 20 cm. Additionally, the amount of liquid water in the underlying frozen soil rapidly increased with increasing temperature. To estimate the SWE, we used a small number of field measurements data and SAR ratio images to develop two equations. The first equation defined the relationship between the snow's thermal resistance and backscattering ratio, and the second equation yielded the SWE from the estimated thermal resistance of the snow-covered area. The root mean square and relative errors of the estimated SWE were approximately 7.41 mm and 6.17\%, respectively. The derived SWE also indicated that blowing snow and sun radiation were two primary factors that determined the spatial distribution of snow cover in mountainous areas.}},

However, the variability in snow density across the Northern Hemisphere (NH) is largely unknown. Here, we investigate snow density variability in conjunction with snow classes and geographic elements in the NH based on 6,954 snow sites from 1909 to 2019. Precipitation, air temperature, and snowfall based on meteorological sites, as well as the aridity index (AI) and wind speed from reanalysis data, are also applied to describe the effect of climate on snow density. The results present that the long-term mean snow density is 246 ± 70 kg/m3 considering all in-situ measurement sites. Considerable spatial heterogeneity in snow density exists with contrasting snow densities among differing snow classes. The values range from 198 ± 79 kg/m3 for ephemeral snow to 363 ± 63 kg/m3 for maritime snow. For the seasonal evolution of snow density, the different snow classes share a general characteristic with the overall NH, a slight decrease from October to September, followed by a sustained increase. Moreover, the densification rate in the snow stable period varies over a much smaller range than that during the snowmelt period. Furthermore, the longitudinal trends in the variability of snow density are more pronounced compared to altitudinal and latitudinal trends. High snow densities are typically associated with adequate precipitation, warm air temperature, large aridity index, a long snow season, and heavy snowfall for different snow classes. The results will deepen the understanding of the snow density distribution at hemispherical scale, and provide basic data for the remote sensing of snow water equivalent and parameterization of snow models.}},

Snow water equivalent (SWE) is the snow-related variable that is most commonly used in hydrology, as it expresses the total quantity of water (solid and liquid) stored in the snowpack. Measurements of SWE are, however, expensive and not continuously accessible in real time. This motivates a search for alternative ways of estimating SWE from measurements that are more widely available and continuous over time. SWE can be calculated by multiplying snow depth by the bulk density of the snowpack. Regression models proposed in the literature first estimate snow density and then calculate SWE. More recently, a novel approach to this problem has been developed and is based on an ensemble of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Although this approach compared favorably with existing regression models, snow density values at the lower and higher ends of the range remained inaccurate. Here, we improve upon this recent method for determining SWE from snow depth. We show the general applicability of the method through the use of a large data set of 234 779 snow depth–density–SWE records from 2878 nonuniformly distributed sites across Canada. These data cover almost 4 decades of snowfall. First, it is shown that the direct estimation of SWE produces better results than the estimation of snow density, followed by the calculation of SWE. Second, testing several artificial neural network (ANN) structural characteristics improves estimates of SWE. Optimizing MLP parameters separately for each snow climate class gives a greater representation of the geophysical diversity of snow. Furthermore, the uncertainty of snow depth measurements is included for a more realistic estimation. A comparison with commonly used regression models reveals that the ensemble of MLPs proposed here leads to noticeably more accurate estimates of SWE. This study thus shows that delving deeper into ANN theory helps improve SWE estimation.}},

Permanent scatterers (PSs) are helpful to overcome these problems, but their density in agricultural and out-of-town areas is not always sufficient. The forthcoming availability of satellite platforms with thinner orbital tubes and shorter revisit times will enhance the use of interferogram stacks, which are usable for distributed and progressively decorrelating targets, like those found in agricultural areas. To estimate the possibilities of the interferogram stack technique, a Markovian model for the temporal decorrelation is considered. ERS-1 data measured in C-band over Rome with a three-day repeat cycle are used to identify the parameters for this model, namely, the decorrelation time (estimated as 40 days) and the short-term coherence (estimated as 0.6). In the hypothesis of small deviations from a model of the motion, the optimal weights to be used to combine a sequence of interferograms taken at intervals that are shorter than the decorrelation time are calculated in the cases of progressive and sinusoidal ground motion. The dispersion of the optimal estimate of the motion is then determined. This model is extended to frequencies other than C-band. These evaluations are compared with the known results obtained for PSs. As an example, the case of a time interval between the takes of \$T = 12\textbackslash \textbackslashhbox\{days\}\$ is considered. With \$N\$ consecutive images, interferogram stack results are equivalent to PSs if the pixel count in the window used to smooth the interferograms grows with \$N\textasciicircum\{2\}\$.}},

abstract = {{Abstract. Area-based measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) are important for understanding earth system processes such as glacier mass balance, winter hydrological storage in drainage basins, and ground thermal regimes. Remote sensing techniques are ideally suited for wide-scale area-based mapping with the most commonly used technique to measure SWE being passive microwave, which is limited to coarse spatial resolutions of 25 km or greater and to areas without significant topographic variation. Passive microwave also has a negative bias for large SWE. Another method is repeat-pass synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) that allows measurement of SWE change at much higher spatial resolution. However, it has not been widely adopted because (1) the phase unwrapping problem has not been robustly addressed, especially for interferograms with poor coherence, and (2) SWE change maps scaled directly from repeat-pass interferograms are not an absolute measurement but contain unknown offsets for each contiguous coherent area. We develop and test a novel method for repeat-pass InSAR-based dry-snow SWE estimation that exploits the sensitivity of the dry-snow refraction-induced InSAR phase to topographic variations. The method robustly estimates absolute SWE change at spatial resolutions of < 1 km without the need for phase unwrapping. We derive a quantitative signal model for this new SWE change estimator and identify the relevant sources of bias. The method is demonstrated using both simulated SWE distributions and a 9-year RADARSAT-2 (C-band, 5.405 GHz) spotlight-mode dataset near Inuvik, Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. SWE results are compared to in situ snow survey measurements and estimates from ERA5 reanalysis. Our method performs well in high-relief areas, thus providing complementary coverage to passive-microwave-based SWE estimation. Further, our method has the advantage of requiring only a single wavelength band and thus can utilize existing spaceborne synthetic aperture radar systems.}},

Here we utilize Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to track ablation season development of wet snow in the Shigar Watershed of the Karakoram Mountains in Pakistan from 2015 to 2018. We exploit opportune local image acquisition times to highlight diurnal differences in radar indications of wet snow, and examine the spatial and temporal contexts of radar diurnal differences for 2015, 2017, and 2018 ablation seasons. Radar classifications for each ablation season show spatial and temporal patterns that indicate a dry winter snowpack undergoing diurnal surface melt-refreeze cycles, transitioning to surface snow that remains wet both day and night, and finally snow free conditions following melt out. Diurnally differing SAR signals may offer insights into important snowpack energy balance processes that precede melt out, which could provide useful constraints for both glacier mass balance modeling and runoff forecasting in remote alpine watersheds.}},

abstract = {{Snow surface temperature is a key control on and result of dynamically coupled energy exchanges at the snow surface. The snow surface temperature is the result of the balance between external forcing (incoming radiation) and energy exchanges above the surface that depend on surface temperature (outgoing longwave radiation and turbulent fluxes) and the transport of energy into the snow by conduction and meltwater influx. Because of the strong insulating properties of snow, thermal gradients in snow packs are large and nonlinear, a fact that has led many to advocate multiple layer snowmelt models over single layer models. In an effort to keep snowmelt modeling simple and parsimonious, the Utah Energy Balance (UEB) snowmelt model used only one layer but allowed the snow surface temperature to be different from the snow average temperature by using an equilibrium gradient parameterization based on the surface energy balance. Although this procedure was considered an improvement over the ordinary single layer snowmelt models, it still resulted in discrepancies between modeled and measured snowpack energy contents. In this paper we evaluate the equilibrium gradient approach, the force-restore approach, and a modified force-restore approach when they are integrated as part of a complete energy and mass balance snowmelt model. The force-restore and modified force-restore approaches have not been incorporated into the UEB in early versions, even though Luce and Tartoton have done work in calculating the energy components using these approaches. In addition, we evaluate a scheme for representing the penetration of a refreezing front in cold periods following melt. We introduce a method to adjust effective conductivity to account for the presence of ground near to a shallow snow surface. These parameterizations were tested against data from the Central Sierra Snow Laboratory, CA, Utah State University experimental farm, UT, and subnivean snow laboratory at Niwot Ridge, CO. These tests compare modeled and measured snow surface temperature, snow energy content, snow water equivalent, and snowmelt outflow. We found that with these refinements the model is able to better represent the snowpack energy balance and internal energy content while still retaining a parsimonious one layer format.}},

abstract = {{Maps of snow cover serve as early indicators for hydrologic forecasts and as inputs to hydrologic models that inform water management strategies. Advances in snow cover mapping have led to increasing accuracy, but unsatisfactory treatment of vegetation's interference when mapping snow has led to maps that have limited utility for water forecasting. Vegetation affects snow mapping because ground surfaces not visible to the satellite produce uncertainty as to whether the ground is snow covered. At nadir, the forest canopy obscures the satellite view below the canopy. At oblique viewing angles, the forest floor is obscured by both the canopy and the projection of tree profiles onto the forest floor. We present a canopy correction method based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery validated with field observations that mitigates geometric and georegistration issues associated with changing satellite acquisition angles in forested areas. The largest effect from a variable viewing zenith angle on the viewable gap fraction in forested areas occurs in moderately forested areas with 30–40\% tree canopy coverage. Cloud cover frequently causes errors in snow identification, with some clouds identified as snow and some snow identified as cloud. A snow‐cloud identification method utilizes a time series of fractional vegetation and rock land‐surface data to flag snow‐cloud identification errors and improve snow‐map accuracy reducing bias by 20\% over previous methods. Together, these contributions to snow‐mapping techniques could advance hydrologic forecasting in forested, snow‐dominated basins that comprise an estimated one fifth of Northern Hemisphere snow‐covered areas. Mapping snow cover extent informs water resources stored in the winter snowpack, providing important information for planning how and when to utilize available water. Tree canopies shield the forest floor and hinder the determination of snow‐covered area in vegetated terrain from above, where satellites view the Earth's surface. Moreover, satellites that scan the surface (like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) are most often not directly overhead, and as the view from the satellite to the surface slants, trees obscure a greater portion of the land surface that a satellite can “see,” especially where trees are tall, adding uncertainty to the satellite‐based maps. This effect is greatest in forests where 30–40\% of the land area is covered by tree canopy and has little effect in very dense forests where most of the forest floor is obscured already. Here we present a method to accommodate the stretched and hidden forest footprint when a satellite is not directly overhead. A new method for identifying snow‐mapping errors caused by clouds is also presented by flagging unusually large changes in the non‐snow surfaces over sequential images. These methodological advancements are important because snow‐melt water comprises a major portion of the water supply in many regions where humans live. The canopy correction methodology improves remotely sensed snow mapping accuracy in forested environments, reducing bias by 20\% A novel cloud detection algorithm that uses fractional vegetation and rock coverage can reduce snow‐cloud identification errors Improved performance over previous snow mapping approaches enable melt out date identification within days of actual snow disappearance}},

Recently lidar has seen a dramatic widening of applications in the natural sciences, resulting in technological improvements and an increase in the availability of both airborne and ground-based sensors. Modern sensors allow mapping of vegetation heights and snow or ground surface elevations below forest canopies. Typical vertical accuracies for airborne datasets are decimeter-scale with order 1 m point spacings. Ground-based systems typically provide millimeter-scale range accuracy and sub-meter point spacing over 1 m to several kilometers. Many system parameters, such as scan angle, pulse rate and shot geometry relative to terrain gradients, require specification to achieve specific point coverage densities in forested and/or complex terrain. Additionally, snow has a significant volumetric scattering component, requiring different considerations for error estimation than for other Earth surface materials. We use published estimates of light penetration depth by wavelength to estimate radiative transfer error contributions. This paper presents a review of lidar mapping procedures and error sources, potential errors unique to snow surface remote sensing in the near-infrared and visible wavelengths, and recommendations for projects using lidar for snow-depth mapping.}},

To assess the improved correlation properties of L-band with respect to C-band, we analyzed L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) interferograms with a range of temporal and spatial baselines over three vegetated areas in California and compared them with corresponding C-band European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) interferograms. Over the highly vegetated Northern California forests in the Coast Range area, ALOS remains remarkably well correlated over a 2-year period, whereas an ERS interferogram with a similar temporal and spatial baseline lost correlation. In Central California near Parkfield, we found a similar pattern in decorrelation behavior, which enabled the recovery of a fault creep and a local uplifting signal at L-band that was not apparent at C-band. In the Imperial Valley in Southern California, both ALOS and ERS have low correlation over farmlands. ALOS has lower correlation over some sandy surfaces than ERS, probably due to low signal-to-noise ratio. In general, L-band interferograms with similar seasonal acquisitions have higher correlation than those with dissimilar season. For both L- and C-band, correlation over vegetated areas decreases with time for intervals less than 1 year and then remains relatively constant at longer time intervals. The decorrelation time for L-band is more than 2 years in the forest in California whereas that for C-band is less than 6 months. Overall, these results suggest that L-band interferograms will reveal near-fault interseismic deformation once sufficient data become available.}},

Unfortunately, most radars cannot measure t and site surveys are not accurate enough to determine r with the part-per-million accuracy required to obtain useful information about n. However, if the range to the target is fixed, but only known to a fair accuracy, say better than 1\%, it would be enough to allow us to relate changes in t to changes in n; the absolute calibration would then have to be done by other means.

The authors' polarimetric model shows that scattering mechanisms control the relationship between snow wetness and the copolarization signals in data from a multi-parameter synthetic aperture radar. Along with snow wetness, the surface roughness and local incidence angle also affect the copolarization signals, making them either larger or smaller depending on the snow parameters, surface roughness, and incidence angle. The authors base their algorithm for retrieving snow wetness from SIR-C/X-SAR on a first-order scattering model that includes both surface and volume scattering. It is applicable for incidence angles from 25/spl deg/-70/spl deg/ and for surface roughness with rms height /spl les/7 mm and correlation length /spl les/25 cm. Comparison with ground measurements showed that the absolute error in snow wetness inferred from the imagery was within 2.5\% at 95\% confidence interval.

This paper presents a theoretical and experimental study of snowpack sensing using radar interferometry. An approximate model of interferometric sensing based on the small perturbation method is proposed. As opposed to the well-known interferometric model, the proposed one takes into account microwave backscattering from the snow surface. We estimated the contribution of scattering from the snow surface to amplitude and interferometric phase values.

The experiment consisted of comparing the phases of radar signals received when there was no snowpack (in September) and those in its presence (in February). We used a reference scatterer in the form of a trihedral corner reflector to calibrate the phase measurements. The SWE values were restored from the linear dependence between SWE and the interferometric phase. A comparison between the calculated and experimental data shows their good agreement.}},

Forcing uncertainty is enhanced in snow-affected catchments, where weather stations are scarce and prone to measurement errors, and meteorological variables exhibit high variability. Hence, there is limited understanding of how forcing error characteristics affect simulations of cold region hydrology and which error characteristics are most important. Here we employ global sensitivity analysis to explore how (1) different error types (i.e., bias, random errors), (2) different error probability distributions, and (3) different error magnitudes influence physically based simulations of four snow variables (snow water equivalent, ablation rates, snow disappearance, and sublimation). We use the Sobol' global sensitivity analysis, which is typically used for model parameters but adapted here for testing model sensitivity to coexisting errors in all forcings. We quantify the Utah Energy Balance model's sensitivity to forcing errors with 1 840 000 Monte Carlo simulations across four sites and five different scenarios. Model outputs were (1) consistently more sensitive to forcing biases than random errors, (2) generally less sensitive to forcing error distributions, and (3) critically sensitive to different forcings depending on the relative magnitude of errors. For typical error magnitudes found in areas with drifting snow, precipitation bias was the most important factor for snow water equivalent, ablation rates, and snow disappearance timing, but other forcings had a more dominant impact when precipitation uncertainty was due solely to gauge undercatch. Additionally, the relative importance of forcing errors depended on the model output of interest. Sensitivity analysis can reveal which forcing error characteristics matter most for hydrologic modeling.}},

This data set is validated using independent SWE reference data from Russia, the former Soviet Union, Finland and Canada. The validation of SWE time-series indicates overall strong retrieval performance with root mean square errors below 40mm for cases when SWE <150mm. Retrieval uncertainty increases when SWE is above this threshold. The SWE estimates are also compared with results obtained by a typical stand-alone satellite passive microwave algorithm.

It has been, however, documented that temporal variations in surface backscattering due to the change in surface parameters, i.e., dielectric constant, roughness, and the geometry of scatterers, can result in gradual, seasonal, or sudden decorrelations and loss of InSAR coherence. The coherence models introduced so far have largely neglected the effect of the temporal change in backscattering on InSAR coherence. Here, we introduce a new temporal decorrelation model that considers changes in surface backscattering by utilizing the relative change in SAR intensity between two images as a proxy for the change in surface scattering parameters. The model also takes into account the decorrelation due to the change in snow depth between two images. Using the L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS-2) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR-2) data, the model has been assessed over forested and shrub landscapes in Delta Junction, Interior Alaska. The model decreases the RMS error of temporal coherence estimation from 0.18 to 0.09 on average. The improvements made by the model have been statistically proved to be significant at the 99\% confidence level. Additionally, the model shows that the coherence of forested areas are more prone to changes in backscattering than shrub landscape. The model is based on L-band data and may not be expanded to C-band or X-band InSAR observations.}},

abstract = {{Seasonal snow cover is the largest single component of the cryosphere in areal extent, covering an average of 46×106 km2 of Earth's surface (31 \% of the land area) each year, and is thus an important expression and driver of the Earth's climate. In recent years, Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has been declining at about the same rate (∼ -13 \% per decade) as Arctic summer sea ice. More than one-sixth of the world's population relies on seasonal snowpack and glaciers for a water supply that is likely to decrease this century. Snow is also a critical component of Earth's cold regions' ecosystems, in which wildlife, vegetation, and snow are strongly interconnected. Snow water equivalent (SWE) describes the quantity of water stored as snow on the land surface and is of fundamental importance to water, energy, and geochemical cycles. Quality global SWE estimates are lacking. Given the vast seasonal extent combined with the spatially variable nature of snow distribution at regional and local scales, surface observations are not able to provide sufficient SWE information. Satellite observations presently cannot provide SWE information at the spatial and temporal resolutions required to address science and high-socio-economic-value applications such as water resource management and streamflow forecasting. In this paper, we review the potential contribution of X- and Ku-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for global monitoring of SWE. SAR can image the surface during both day and night regardless of cloud cover, allowing high-frequency revisit at high spatial resolution as demonstrated by missions such as Sentinel-1. The physical basis for estimating SWE from X- and Ku-band radar measurements at local scales is volume scattering by millimeter-scale snow grains. Inference of global snow properties from SAR requires an interdisciplinary approach based on field observations of snow microstructure, physical snow modeling, electromagnetic theory, and retrieval strategies over a range of scales. New field measurement capabilities have enabled significant advances in understanding snow microstructure such as grain size, density, and layering. We describe radar interactions with snow-covered landscapes, the small but rapidly growing number of field datasets used to evaluate retrieval algorithms, the characterization of snowpack properties using radar measurements, and the refinement of retrieval algorithms via synergy with other microwave remote sensing approaches. This review serves to inform the broader snow research, monitoring, and application communities on progress made in recent decades and sets the stage for a new era in SWE remote sensing from SAR measurements.}},

abstract = {{Radar instruments have been widely used to measure snow water equivalent (SWE) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar is a promising approach for doing so from spaceborne platforms. Electromagnetic waves propagate through the snowpack at a velocity determined by its dielectric permittivity. Velocity estimates are a significant source of uncertainty in radar SWE retrievals, especially in wet snow. In dry snow, velocity can be calculated from relations between permittivity and snow density. However, wet snow velocity is a function of both snow density and liquid water content (LWC); the latter exhibits high spatiotemporal variability, there is no standard observation method, and it is not typically measured by automated stations. In this study, we used ground-penetrating radar (GPR), probed snow depths, and measured in situ vertically-averaged density to estimate SWE and bulk LWC for seven survey dates at Cameron Pass, Colorado (\textbackslashtextasciitilde3120 m) from April to June 2019. During this cooler than average season, median LWC for individual survey dates never exceeded 7 vol. \%. However, in June, LWC values greater than 10 vol. \% were observed in isolated areas where the ground and the base of the snowpack were saturated and therefore inhibited further meltwater output. LWC development was modulated by canopy cover and meltwater drainage was influenced by ground slope. We generated synthetic SWE retrievals that resemble the planned footprint of the NASA-ISRO L-band InSAR satellite (NISAR) from GPR using a dry snow density model. Synthetic SWE retrievals overestimated observed SWE by as much as 40\% during the melt season due to the presence of LWC. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering LWC variability in order to fully realize the potential of future spaceborne radar missions for measuring SWE.}},

A multitemporal (three winters) SAR data set was obtained using the Convair-580 from the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS) over a watershed in the Appalachian Mountains in Southern Quebec, Canada. The SAR data were relatively calibrated using extended targets (coniferous stands). Extensive ground measurements were done simultaneously to each of the seven flights, in order to measure the snow cover characteristics (depth, density, SWE, liquid water content, temperature, and dielectric profiles) as well as the soil characteristics (moisture, temperature). To estimate the SWE of a given snowpack, a model which links the scattering coefficient to the physical parameters of the snow cover and the underlying soil has been developed. The model is based on the ratio of the scattering coefficient of a field covered by snow to the scattering coefficient of a field without snow. The analysis has revealed that volume scattering from a shallow dry snow cover (SWE<20 cm) is undetectable. The backscattering power is dominated by soil surface scattering, the latter varying with the decrease of liquid water content in the surface layer with decreasing soil temperature below 0/spl deg/C. Then, the scattering ratio decreases proportionally to the dielectric constant of the soil in winter. Furthermore, a unique relationship for three acquisition dates has been found between the thermal resistance, R, of the snow pack and the backscattering power ratio. Then, the spatial distribution of the power ratio should depict the spatial distribution of R, given spatially uniform climatological conditions over the study area. Since linear relationships between SWE and R have been observed, it should be possible to estimate the SWE of shallow dry snow cover with C-band SAR data using few ground truthing data in an open area when the soil is frozen.}},

It is demonstrated that an accurate modeling of the liquid water distribution inside the snowpack, using a multilayer meteorological snow model, is required to characterize snow with precision. A multilayer-snow electromagnetic (EM) backscattering model is developed based on the vector radiative transfer, the strong fluctuation theory, and physical parameters supplied by the meteorological model. However, the limited resolution of the meteorological snow model is insufficient for predicting a refined EM backscattering at a massif scale. An adequate spatial reorganization of these snow profiles, based on a comparison between simulated and measured dual-polarization SAR data, leads to a better estimation of some snowpack parameters. In particular, the monitoring of snow liquid water content is presented improving the capacity of wet snow mapping as compared to a classical SAR-based method. This methodology shows good capacities both for qualitative and quantitative snow assessments, opening the way for a new operational method.}},

This data dependence is increasingly challenged, with global and regional climatological factors changing the seasonal snowpack dynamics in mountain watersheds. To evaluate and improve the CBRFC modeling options, this work ran the physically based snow energy balance iSnobal model, forced with outputs from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) numerical weather prediction model across 4 years in a Colorado River Basin forecast region. Compared to in situ, remotely sensed, and the current operational CBRFC model data, the HRRR-iSnobal combination showed well-reconstructed snow depth patterns and magnitudes until peak accumulation. Once snowmelt set in, HRRR-iSnobal showed slower simulated snowmelt relative to observations, depleting snow on average up to 34 d later. The melting period is a critical component for water forecasting. Based on the results, there is a need for revised forcing data input preparation (shortwave radiation) required by iSnobal, which is a recommended future improvement to the model. Nevertheless, the presented performance and architecture make HRRR-iSnobal a promising combination for the CBRFC production needs, where there is a demonstrated change to the seasonal snow in the mountain ranges around the Colorado River Basin. The long-term goal is to introduce the HRRR-iSnobal combination in day-to-day CBRFC operations, and this work created the foundation to expand and evaluate larger CBRFC domains.}},

Observed Q from 3000 to 4000 small-to-medium-sized catchments (10–10 000 km2) around the globe were used to train neural network ensembles to estimate Q characteristics based on climate and physiographic characteristics of the catchments. In total, 17 Q characteristics were selected, including mean annual Q, baseflow index, and a number of flow percentiles. Testing coefficients of determination for the estimation of the Q characteristics ranged from 0.55 for the baseflow recession constant to 0.93 for the Q timing. Overall, climate indices dominated among the predictors. Predictors related to soils and geology were relatively unimportant, perhaps because of their data quality. The trained neural network ensembles were subsequently applied spatially over the entire ice-free land surface, resulting in global maps of the Q characteristics (at 0.125° resolution). These maps possess several unique features: they represent observation-driven estimates, they are based on an unprecedentedly large set of catchments, and they have associated uncertainty estimates. The maps can be used for various hydrological applications, including the diagnosis of macroscale hydrological models. To demonstrate this, the produced maps were compared to equivalent maps derived from the simulated daily Q of four macroscale hydrological models, highlighting various opportunities for improvement in model Q behavior.

Warmer temperatures will reduce snowpack and snow-dominated watersheds will transition to mixed rain and snow, while mixed rain and snow dominated watersheds will shift towards rain dominated. This will result in high flows occurring more commonly in late autumn and winter rather than spring, and lower low flows in summer, phenomena that may already be occurring in the Pacific Northwest. Higher peak flows are expected to increase the frequency and magnitude of flooding, which may increase erosion and scouring of the streambed and concurrent risks to roads, culverts, and bridges. Mapping of projected peak flow changes near roads gives an opportunity to mitigate these potential risks. Diminished snowpack and low summer flows are expected to cause a reduction in water supply for aquatic ecosystems, agriculture, municipal consumption, and livestock grazing, although this effect will not be as prominent in areas with substantial amounts of groundwater. Advanced planning could help reduce conflict among water users. Responding pro-actively to climate risks by improving current management practices, like road design and water management as highlighted here, may be among the most efficient and effective methods for adaptation.}},

Wind speed inside a 2-m-high 50\%-porous hexagonal barrier coated with a fine wire mesh is reduced from ambient levels by 90\%. If the infrasound wind-noise level reductions are all plotted versus the reduced frequency given by f*L/ν, where L is the characteristic size of the array or barrier, f is the frequency, and ν is the wind speed, the reductions at different wind speeds are observed to collapse into a single curve for each wind-noise reduction method. The reductions are minimal below a reduced frequency of 0.3 to 1, depending on the device, then spatial averaging over the turbulence structure leads to increased reduction. Above the reduced corner frequency, the barrier reduces infrasonic noise by up to 20 to 25 dB. Below the corner frequency the barrier displays a small reduction of about 4 dB. The rosettes display no reduction below the corner frequency. One other advantage of the wind barrier over rosette spatial filters is that the signal recorded inside the barrier enters the microbarometer from free air and is not integrated, possibly out of phase, after propagation through a system of narrow pipes.}},

In other natural, heterogeneous materials monitoring AE has proven to be a valuable tool for stability estimation and failure prediction. After studying the characteristics of ultrasonic wave propagation in snow, we measured the acoustic emission signals during snow loading experiments in a cold laboratory. Using snow columns we found that most energy of an artificial acoustic signal was transmitted at 31kHz. Best coupling to snow was achieved by attaching the AE sensors with silicone adhesive to thin aluminium plates which were then frozen to the snow. Localizing AE events during fracture of layered snow samples showed that the AE originated within the weakest layer, i.e. the relevant layer for snow failure. For finding an indication of imminent failure, we analysed the exponent β of the cumulative size-frequency distribution (‘survival curve’) of event energy. At the occurrence of instabilities, the β-curve deviated from steady behaviour and exhibited distinct ‘drops’, indicating that the power law behaviour of the distribution was not fulfilled anymore. Studying the temporal evolution of the exponent β might therefore provide useful information about snowpack stability also in the field—provided that the AE signals are not too strongly attenuated and can be detected in time before catastrophic failure occurs.}},

This eliminates perceived climate jumps associated with changes in the data assimilation system. The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data assimilation system and a database as complete as possible. The data assimilation and the model used are identical to the global system implemented operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210 km). The database has been enhanced with many sources of observations not available in real time for operations, provided by different countries and organizations. The system has been designed with advanced quality control and monitoring components, and can produce 1 mon of reanalysis per day on a Cray YMP/8 supercomputer. Different types of output archives are being created to satisfy different user needs, including a “quick look” CD-ROM (one per year) with six tropospheric and stratospheric fields available twice daily, as well as surface, top-of-the-atmosphere, and isentropic fields. Reanalysis information and selected output is also available on-line via the Internet (http//:nic.fb4.noaa.gov:8000). A special CD-ROM, containing 13 years of selected observed, daily, monthly, and climatological data from the NCEP/NCAR Re-analysis, is included with this issue. Output variables are classified into four classes, depending on the degree to which they are influenced by the observations and/or the model. For example, “C” variables (such as precipitation and surface fluxes) are completely determined by the model during the data assimilation and should be used with caution. Nevertheless, a comparison of these variables with observations and with several climatologies shows that they generally contain considerable useful information. Eight-day forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful for predictability studies and for monitoring the quality of the observing systems. The 40 years of reanalysis (1957–96) should be completed in early 1997. A continuation into the future through an identical Climate Data Assimilation System will allow researchers to reliably compare recent anomalies with those in earlier decades. Since changes in the observing systems will inevitably produce perceived changes in the climate, parallel reanalyses (at least 1 year long) will be generated for the periods immediately after the introduction of new observing systems, such as new types of satellite data. NCEP plans currently call for an updated reanalysis using a state-of-the-art system every five years or so. The successive reanalyses will be greatly facilitated by the generation of the comprehensive database in the present reanalysis.}},

We investigate the ability of the Sentinel-1 mission to monitor snow depth at sub-kilometer (100 m, 500 m, and 1 km) resolutions over the European Alps for 2017–2019. The Sentinel-1 backscatter observations, especially in cross-polarization, show a high correlation with regional model simulations of snow depth over Austria and Switzerland. The observed changes in radar backscatter with the accumulation or ablation of snow are used in an empirical change detection algorithm to retrieve snow depth. The algorithm includes the detection of dry and wet snow conditions. Compared to in situ measurements at 743 sites in the European Alps, dry snow depth retrievals at 500 m and 1 km resolution have a spatio-temporal correlation of 0.89. The mean absolute error equals 20 \%–30 \% of the measured values for snow depths between 1.5 and 3 m. The performance slightly degrades for retrievals at the finer 100 m spatial resolution as well as for retrievals of shallower and deeper snow. The results demonstrate the ability of Sentinel-1 to provide snow estimates in mountainous regions where satellite-based estimates of snow mass are currently lacking. The retrievals can improve our knowledge of seasonal snow mass in areas with complex topography and benefit a number of applications, such as water resource management, flood forecasting, and numerical weather prediction.

abstract = {{Acoustic signals interact with the physical structure of porous media, are particularly sensitive to porosity and tortuosity, and can be used to measure physical properties in a non-destructive manner. Given the fragile nature of freshly fallen snow, non-contact, non-destructive characterization methods made possible via acoustic signals, are desirable. High frequency wave propagation methods can be used to determine in-situ, near-surface, micro-pore geometry parameters in snow using methods demonstrated on cohesive porous materials, including manufactured foams, porous metals, and sintered glass beads. High frequency (90 kHz), oblique-angle and near vertical reflection measurements were conducted on snow samples in a cold room to demonstrate the feasibility of acoustic characterization. A nonlinear least squares regression to the theoretical reflection response was used to derive the best-fitting values for the porosity and tortuosity. We compared the acoustically-derived snow physical parameters, including porosity and tortuosity, with values determined from X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT) for different snow types. The μCT-measured and acoustically-derived methods demonstrated strong agreement for porosity with differences averaging 8\% for all samples. Tortuosity values, however, had average differences of roughly 20\% for all samples. The different error rates might be caused by the stronger dependence of the acoustic reflection on porosity than on tortuosity. For both parameters, the small grain snow and large grain firn samples had errors much larger than the fresh or 1 day samples. Fresh snow has the lowest reflection coefficients and demonstrates a steady decrease from <0.1 at normal incidence as the angle increases. Aging fresh snow for 1 day caused detectable changes in acoustic response, from slight decreases in porosity, and slight increases in tortuosity that occurred from sintering.}},

We studied the frequency-dependent attenuation of sound, vertical sound speed, and wind noise reduction in a natural snowpack using earthquakes as a natural source of infrasound. Our experiment used a 2 m vertical distribution of sensors deployed during the 2021–2022 winter in the Sawtooth mountains of Idaho. We recorded 38 earthquakes and their primary infrasound propagating vertically upward through the snow. For these events, average attenuation appeared negligible between 0 and 8 Hz, rose to 0.1 dB/cm at ∼12 Hz, and remained at this level for higher frequencies. Using timing lags across the vertical profile the speed of infrasound in the snow was measured at 160 ± 51 m/s, significantly subsonic and indicative of pore-space waves. Finally, we quantified the significant reduction in the amount of background noise measured for snow-buried compared with free-air sensors. The 24 dB of reduction of noise observed for high wind speed conditions was evident with only 20 cm of snow burial and demonstrates the powerful capability of snowpack as a noise reduction filter. This study provides a clearer understanding of how snow burial filters infrasound and minimizes noise levels and has implications for monitoring of both natural and human-made hazards.}},

The water resources community needs accurate snow depth data for improved basin-wide snow depth estimates. The NASA ICESat-2 mission has provided over four years of global satellite laser altimetry measurements since October 2018. Previous studies have shown that standard ICESat-2 data products, when combined with snow-off digital terrain models (DTMs) from airborne laser scanning, have the potential to provide snow depth measurements with varying accuracy depending on factors such as surface slope and canopy cover. In this study we show that ICESat-2 snow depth measurements can be improved with customized data products generated using the SlideRule Earth service. Here we investigate the accuracy of our ICESat-2 SlideRule snow depth method using four years (2019–2022) of reference in situ snow depth measurements and airborne lidar snow depth observations for two watersheds with varying terrain characteristics: the Tuolumne River basin above Hetch Hetchy, CA and the Methow Valley, WA. We observe median differences of −0.14 m (RMSE of 0.18 m) and −0.20 m (RMSE of 0.33 m) between our ICESat-2 snow depth measurements and reference snow depth measurements for the Tuolumne Basin and Methow Valley sites, respectively. While individual ICESat-2 elevation measurements can contain noise, basin-scale aggregation offers robust statistics for snow depth. Differences in accuracy between sites are attributed to terrain characteristics and their spatial distributions. The customized ICESat-2 SlideRule data products used in this study resulted in more accurate median snow depth values, including under canopy, than those found by previous studies using standard ICESat-2 data products in mid-latitude mountainous regions. When combined with snow-off DTMs, the aggregated snow-on ICESat-2 SlideRule observations could provide a new snow depth dataset across the western U.S. and potentially global land surfaces.}},

Snow has high albedo and emissivity that cool the snow surface, high absorptivity that tends to warm the snow surface, low thermal conductivity so that a snow layer acts as an insulator, and high latent heat due to snowmelt that is a heat sink. The overall impact of snow cover on the ground thermal regime depends on the timing, duration, accumulation, and melting processes of seasonal snow cover; density, structure, and thickness of seasonal snow cover; and interactions of snow cover with micrometeorological conditions, local microrelief, vegetation, and the geographical locations. Over different timescales either the cooling or warming impact of seasonal snow cover may dominate. In the continuous permafrost regions, impact of seasonal snow cover can result in an increase of the mean annual ground and permafrost surface temperature by several degrees, whereas in discontinuous and sporadic permafrost regions the absence of seasonal snow cover may be a key factor for permafrost development. In seasonally frozen ground regions, snow cover can substantially reduce the seasonal freezing depth. However, the influence of seasonal snow cover on seasonally frozen ground has received relatively little attention, and further study is needed. Ground surface temperatures, reconstructed from deep borehole temperature gradients, have increased by up to 4°C in the past centuries and have been widely used as evidence of paleoclimate change. However, changes in air temperature alone cannot account for the changes in ground temperatures. Changes in seasonal snow conditions might have significantly contributed to the ground surface temperature increase. The influence of seasonal snow cover on soil temperature, soil freezing and thawing processes, and permafrost has considerable impact on carbon exchange between the atmosphere and the ground and on the hydrological cycle in cold regions/cold seasons.}},

All of the memory allocations from the original code have been reduced to the size of the local sub-domains, allowing each core to perform fewer computations and requiring less memory for each process. A majority of the subroutines in SnowModel were simple to parallelize; however, there were certain physical processes, including blowing snow redistribution and components within the solar radiation and wind models, that required non-trivial parallelization using halo-exchange patterns. To validate the parallel algorithm and assess parallel scaling characteristics, high-resolution (100 m grid) simulations were performed over several western United States domains and over the contiguous United States (CONUS).

Snow cover extent monitoring has been one such application where microwave sensors have been a popular choice due to their sensitivity toward the dielectric property. Snow is a dynamic matter since its dielectric state is dependent on climatic factors prevailing locally around it. In the literature, the polarization fraction (PF) has been used for landcover characterization. In this paper, we utilize the seasonal variation of the PF for mapping snow cover over the Himalayan terrain. Temporal variation of the strength in the polarized return due to change in landcover and season is the prime motivation behind this approach. In addition, the effect of SAR data acquisition time on mapping algorithms is considered in this work which is seldom discussed in the literature. Furthermore, a study is conducted to analyze the seasonal variation in the entropy (\$H\$) and the scattering type ( \$\textbackslashalpha\$) parameters over the bare snow-covered ground and the forested areas. The seasonal response of the terrain in the \$H/\textbackslashalpha\$ plane corresponding to specific scattering characteristics is analyzed. The applicability of the approach is tested with RADARSAT-2 (FQ28) C-band full polarimetric image pairs over the ManaliDhundi region, Himachal Pradesh, India, located in the western Hindu-Kush Himalayas.

Despite its importance, this information is incomplete today and only available for limited areas and limited time periods. Manual avalanche mapping from satellite imagery has recently been applied to reduce this gap achieving promising results. However, their reliability and completeness were not yet verified satisfactorily.  In our study we attempt a full validation of the completeness of visually detected and mapped avalanches from optical SPOT-6, Sentinel-2 and radar Sentinel-1 imagery. We examine manually mapped avalanches from two avalanche periods in 2018 and 2019 for an area of approximately 180 km2 around Davos, Switzerland relying on ground- and helicopter-based photographs as ground truth. For the quality assessment, we investigate the Probability of Detection (POD) and the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). Additionally, we relate our results to conditions which potentially influence avalanche detection in the satellite imagery.  We statistically confirm the high potential of SPOT for comprehensive avalanche mapping for selected periods (POD = 0.74, PPV = 0.88) as well as the reliability of Sentinel-1 for the mapping of larger avalanches (POD = 0.27, PPV = 0.87). Furthermore, we proof that Sentinel-2 is unsuitable for the mapping of most avalanches due to its spatial resolution (POD = 0.06, PPV = 0.81). Because we could apply the same reference avalanche events for all three satellite mappings, our validation results are robust and comparable. We demonstrate that satellite-based avalanche mapping has the potential to fill the existing avalanche documentation gap over large areas, making alpine regions safer.}},

A modified version of the snow cover model SNOWPACK is used to successfully reproduce the artificially compacted and the additionally covered snow cover in a physically based way. Supplementary measurements of crucial material properties of the 4.5mm thin geotextile serve as model input as well. Results indicate that the shortwave reflectivity of the covers is responsible for 46\% of the performance. Thermal insulation of the material (14\%) and a negative latent heat flux due to evaporation of precipitation from the cover surface (10\%) have almost the same contribution. A layer of air between the cover and the snow and ice surface (thickness 7.5cm to 12cm) adds the rest, which is at the upper limit of observations and may therefore also compensate for model errors. This generally explains the high performance of the method in glacier ski resorts and, most importantly, an altitude dependent application limit of the method: the method becomes less effective at lower altitudes, where sensible heat fluxes become more important compared to shortwave radiation.}},

Producing robust estimates of tropospheric delays remains one of the key challenges in increasing the accuracy of ground deformation measurements using InSAR. Recent studies revealed the efficiency of global atmospheric reanalysis to mitigate the impact of tropospheric delays, motivating further exploration of their potential. Here we explore the effectiveness of these models in several geographic and tectonic settings on both single interferograms and time series analysis products. Both hydrostatic and wet contributions to the phase delay are important to account for. We validate these path delay corrections by comparing with estimates of vertically integrated atmospheric water vapor content derived from the passive multispectral imager Medium‐Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, onboard the Envisat satellite. Generally, the performance of the prediction depends on the vigor of atmospheric turbulence. We discuss (1) how separating atmospheric and orbital contributions allows one to better measure long‐wavelength deformation and (2) how atmospheric delays affect measurements of surface deformation following earthquakes, and (3) how such a method allows us to reduce biases in multiyear strain rate estimates by reducing the influence of unevenly sampled seasonal oscillations of the tropospheric delay.

Noise associated with these activities can be substantial and concerns regarding the effects on polar bears have been acknowledged. But the secluded and ephemeral nature of subnivean maternal dens renders the measurement of behavioral and physiological responses of bears to noise exposure challenging, except for rare cases when disturbance‐prompted den abandonment has been documented. These limitations, coupled with the uncertainty associated with the synergistic effects of anthropogenic activities on bears in a rapidly changing Arctic, prompt the need to develop predictive models of disturbance to ensure management guidelines effectively mitigate disturbance. Towards this end, we characterized noise propagation from 9 sources (2 aircraft, 2 over‐tundra tracked vehicles, 4 wheeled on‐road vehicles, and humans walking) used to support industrial activities around artificial snow dens near Milne Point, Alaska, USA, in March–April 2010. We built dens in 4 configurations to mimic variability in den roof thickness and to evaluate differences in noise propagation from when the den was closed compared to being open, similar to den emergence. We integrated these data with an existing polar bear audiogram and developed models to predict auditory‐detection probabilities as a function of distance from the den. Within a closed den, aircraft had high probabilities (detection probability ≥75\%) of being detected by polar bears at distances ≤1.6 km and ground‐based sources had high probabilities of detection at distances ≤0.8 km. On average, closed dens reduced noise levels by 15 decibels (dB) relative to open dens. Our findings indicate that although polar bear snow dens effectively attenuate acoustic sound pressure levels, noise from some industrial support vehicles was likely to be detected farther from dens than previously documented. These results reinforce the importance of maintaining buffer zones around polar bear dens to minimize the potential for den disturbance. © 2020 The Wildlife Society. We report a relatively high (≥0.75) probability that polar bears in dens can hear industrial support vehicles (especially aircraft) from ≤1.6 km away.

In SNOWPACK, the complex texture of snow is described using the four primary microstructure parameters: grain size, bond size, dendricity and sphericity. For each parameter, rate equations are developed that predict the development in time as a function of the environmental conditions. The rate equations are based on theoretical considerations such as mixture theory and on empirical relations. With a classification scheme, the conventional snow grain types are predicted on the basis of those parameters. The approach to link the bulk constitutive properties, viscosity and thermal conductivity to microstructure parameters is novel to the field of snow cover modeling. Expanding on existing knowledge on microstructure-based viscosity and thermal conductivity, a complete description of those quantities applicable to the seasonal snow cover is presented. This includes the strong coupling between physical processes in snow: The bond size, which changes not only through metamorphic processes but also through the process of pressure sintering (included in our viscosity formulation), is at the same time the single most important parameter for snow viscosity and thermal conductivity. Laboratory results are used to illustrate the performance of the formulations presented. The numerical implementation is treated in the companion paper Part I.

ALS generally had greater but similar snow depth values to TLS, and results were not sensitive to the gridded cell size between 0.5 and 5 m. The greatest disagreements were where snow‐off TLS scans had shrubs and high incidence angles, leading to deeper snow depths (>10 cm) from ALS than TLS. The low vegetation and oblique angles caused occlusion in the TLS data and thus produced higher snow‐off bare Earth models relative to the ALS. Furthermore, in subcanopy areas where both ALS and TLS data existed, snow depth differences were comparable to differences in the open. Meanwhile, median values from 52 snow‐probe transects and near‐coincident ALS data had a mean difference of 6 cm, root‐mean‐square difference of 8 cm, mean‐absolute difference of 7 cm, and a mean difference in the standard deviation of 1 cm.

abstract = {{A fluid-saturated, elastic, porous media model is used to describe acoustic wave propagation in snow. This model predicts the existence of two dilatational waves and a shear wave. In homogeneous, isotropic snow the two dilatational waves are uncoupled from one another but involve coupled motion between the interstitial air and ice skeleton. Dilatational waves of the first kind and shear waves are slightly dispersive and attenuated with distance. Dilatational waves of the second kind are strongly dispersive and highly attenuated. The model also predicts that the wave impedance for snow is close to that of air and that snow strongly absorbs acoustic wave energy.Available experimental phase velocity, impedance and attenuation data support the calculated results. Phase velocity measurements indicate three identifiable categories: fast dilatational waves (phase velocity ⩾ 500 m/s), slow dilatational waves (phase velocity < 500 m/s) and shear waves. Wave impedance and attenuation measurements illustrate the low impedance, highly absorbing characteristics of snow. Additional impedance, attenuation and phase velocity data are required to further test and improve the model.}},

These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation’s land cover and land cover change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation’s land resources, the USGS has designed a new generation of NLCD products named NLCD 2016. The NLCD 2016 design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2016 at 2–3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2016: a streamlined process for assembling and preprocessing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2016 production. The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty World Reference System-2 path/row throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall agreement ranging from 71\% to 97\% between land cover classification and reference data was achieved for all tested area and all years.

As transitional areas, wetlands comprise characteristics of both terrestrial and aquatic features, forming a large diversity of wetland types. This study reviews all published articles incorporating TerraSAR-X information into wetland research to provide a comprehensive study of how this sensor has been used with regard to polarization, and the function of the data, time-series analyses, or the assessment of specific wetland ecosystem types. What is evident throughout this literature review is the synergistic fusion of multi-frequency and multi-polarization SAR sensors, sometimes optical sensors, in almost all investigated studies to attain improved wetland classification results. Due to the short revisiting time of the TerraSAR-X sensor, it is possible to compute dense SAR time-series, allowing for a more precise observation of the seasonality in dynamic wetland areas as demonstrated in many of the reviewed studies.}},

For the radiometric calibration, we employ an array of trihedral corner reflectors, as well as distributed targets. We show that UAVSAR is a well-calibrated SAR system for polarimetric applications, with absolute radiometric calibration bias better than 1 dB, residual root-mean-square (RMS) errors of ∼0.7 dB, and RMS phase errors ∼5.3°. For the polarimetric calibration, we have evaluated the methods of Quegan and Ainsworth et al. for crosstalk calibration and find that the method of Quegan gives crosstalk estimates that depend on target type, whereas the method of Ainsworth et al. gives more stable crosstalk estimates.

One test involved transmission of acoustic signals in the frequency range 100-20 000 Hz through natural snow-pack in order to measure signal loss of a point acoustic source. At all frequencies the relatively high-energy input signal decays rapidly by energy dissipation, with nominal diffusion occurring at large distances from the source. Signal persistence is greatest in the frequency range 100-200 Hz, In a second test, acoustic bursts in snow columns under deformation were recorded. Spectrum analysis in the frequency range 500-14000 Hz reveals dominance of signal amplitudes at frequencies between 1 000 and 10 000 Hz. This dominance is attributed to the strong attenuation properties of snow and suggests the use of waveguide or collector techniques to monitor natural acoustic emissions in snow-pack. In a third test several waveguide geometries and materials were evaluated for their acoustic signal interception and transmission characteristics. In general, metallic waveguides show the least attenuation of the configurations tested.}},

Performing the classification requires global datasets of air temperature, precipitation, and land-cover. When introduced in 1995, the finest resolution global datasets of these variables were on a 0.5° × 0.5° latitude-longitude grid (approximately 50 km). Here we revisit the snow classification system and, using new datasets and methods, present a revised classification on a 10-arcsecond × 10-arcsecond latitude-longitude grid (approximately 300 m). We downscaled 0.1° × 0.1° latitude-longitude (approximately 10 km) gridded meteorological climatologies (1981-2019, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts [ECMWF] ReAnalysis, 5 th Generation Land [ERA5-Land]) using MicroMet, a spatially distributed, high-resolution, micro-meteorological model. The resulting air temperature and precipitation datasets were combined with European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) GlobCover land-cover data (as a surrogate for wind speed) to produce the updated classification, which we have applied to all of Earth’s terrestrial areas. We describe this new, high-resolution snow classification dataset, highlight the improvements added to the classification system since its inception, and discuss the utility of the climatological snow classes at this much higher resolution. The snow class dataset (Global Seasonal-Snow Classification 2.0) and the tools used to develop the data are publicly available online at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).}}

Declining trends are observed across all months, states, and climates, but are largest in spring, in the Pacific states, and in locations with mild winter climate. We corroborate and extend these observations using a gridded hydrology model, which also allows a robust estimate of total western snowpack and its decline. We find a large increase in the fraction of locations that posted decreasing trends, and averaged across the western US, the decline in average April 1 snow water equivalent since mid-century is roughly 15–30\% or 25–50 km3, comparable in volume to the West’s largest man-made reservoir, Lake Mead. Mountain snowpack stores huge amounts of water in the western US, supplying much of the water used to grow crops. A team of researchers from Oregon State University and UCLA found that spring snowpack declined almost everywhere, especially in the coastal states and other locations with mild winter climate. (Skiers will be relieved that declines were smaller in winter.) Not surprisingly, the declines are mostly related to warming climate. Using a physically-based model of the hydrologic cycle, which takes daily weather as inputs and computes snow accumulation and melt, runoff, etc., the researchers computed the total snowpack in the western US. Total snowpack declined 15–30\%, and the amount of that lost water is comparable in volume to the West’s largest man-made reservoir, Lake Mead. Many water managers are already planning for a future with less snow, but this research emphasizes that the future is here.}},

Both instruments measure the backscattering coefficients /spl gamma/ at hh, /spl nu//spl nu/, /spl nu/h, and /spl nu/h polarizations and for incidence angles ranging from 0 to 70/spl deg/. The accuracy of /spl gamma/ is generally better than /spl plusmn/1.8 dB, and the scatterometers are well suited for signature studies of natural surfaces. During the two years, the authors performed many backscattering measurements of natural, strongly layered snowcovers and the authors investigated relationships between /spl gamma/ and physical parameters of the snowcover. All measurements were collected in a signature catalogue. They report on results at 40/spl deg/ incidence angle.

In this study, we investigate the hypothesis that a decrease in the fraction of precipitation falling as snow (SWE/P) would increase monthly complementarity of hydro and solar power generation in the western U.S. With a focus on 123 dams responsible for 93\% of generation, we found that these resources are seasonally complementary at about half of dams, as indicated by the sign of correlation coefficients ( ρ ). As hypothesized, average SWE/P at individual dams was generally positively correlated with ρ , but the dependence of ρ on SWE/P was non-linear and SWE/P only explained a modest portion of the variance in complementarity. At each dam, the dependence of annual ρ on interannual variations in SWE/P between 2002–2020 was assessed; these relationships were positive at 72\% of dams but not statistically significant at the level of individual dams. Finally, at the system scale ρ was significantly related to SWE/P, with a stronger relationship observed than the dependence of total hydropower generation on SWE/P. Notably, the system-scale relationship between ρ and SWE/P changed dramatically in the latter part of the temporal domain (2012–2020), with a much steeper slope and greater fraction of variance explained by SWE/P. These results illustrate the historical relationship between SWE/P, monthly complementarity of hydro and solar power, complexities of these relationships due to snow and watershed hydrology and reservoir management, and a change in the observed relationship between SWE/P and hydropower generation timing. To the extent that hydro and solar power generation complementarity is responsive to SWE/P, expected declines in SWE/P may indicate greater seasonal complementarity but reduced hydropower available for load-balancing when solar power generation is highest.}},

Due to refraction, the interferometric phase changes with snow depth and density, which is exploited by the InSAR method. While the method was first proposed two decades ago, qualitative research using experimental data analyzing factors affecting retrieval performance remains scarce. In this work, a tower-based 1–10-GHz, fully polarimetric SAR with InSAR capabilities was used to analyze the effect of meteorological events (air temperature, precipitation intensity, and wind) on the observed temporal decorrelation of interferometric image pairs at L-, S-, C-, and X-bands. These factors were found to be causes of decorrelation in snow, being the temperature the critical variable in the case of snowmelt events. Of the analyzed bands, the L-band presented the best coherence conservation properties. In addition, the phase change between pairs with sufficient coherence was applied to generate estimates of changes in SWE, studying the retrieval errors at different bands and over different temporal baselines. SWE accumulation was calculated from 6 h up to 12 days’ temporal baseline over a nonvegetated area. SWE accumulation profiles were successfully reconstructed for short temporal baselines and low frequencies, while an increase in the retrieval error was observed for high frequencies and long temporal baselines, indicating the limitations of higher frequencies for repeat-pass InSAR retrieval. The analysis was also reproduced over a forested area at the L-band with similar results as to the nonvegetated area.}},

Over the previous eight centuries, regional snowpack variability exhibits strong, decadally persistent north‐south (N‐S) antiphasing of snowpack anomalies. Contrary to the normal regional antiphasing, two intervals of spatially synchronized snow deficits were identified. Snow deficits shown during the 1930s were synchronized north‐south by low cool‐season precipitation, with spring warming (February–March) since the 1980s driving the majority of the recent synchronous snow declines, especially across the low to middle elevations. Spring warming strongly influenced low snowpacks in the north after 1958, but not in the south until after 1980.

Gaps in elastic wave propagation characteristics in snow hinder quantitative interpretation of AE signals. Our study focuses on characterizing the propagation of acoustic reference signals in the ultrasonic range across cylindrical snow samples with varying density (240–450kgm−3). We deduced the acoustic attenuation coefficient within snow by performing experiments with different column lengths to eliminate possible influences of the snow-sensor coupling. The attenuation coefficient was measured for the entire burst signal and for single frequency components in the range of 8 to 35kHz. The acoustic wave propagation speed, calculated from the travel time of the acoustic signal, varied between 300ms−1 and 950ms−1, depending on the density and hardness of snow. From the sound speed we also estimated the Young's modulus of our snow samples; the values of the modulus ranged from 30 to 340MPa for densities between 240 and 450kgm−3. In addition, we modeled the sound propagation for our experimental setup using Biot's model for wave propagation in a porous medium. The model results were in good agreement with our experimental results and suggest that our acoustic signals consisted of Biot's slow and fast waves.

abstract = {{Geostatistics as a subfield of statistics accounts for the spatial correlations encountered in many applications of e.g. Earth Sciences. Valuable information can be extracted from these correlations, also helping to address the often encountered burden of data scarcity. Despite the value of additional data, the use of geostatistics still falls short of its potential. This problem is often connected to the lack of user-friendly software hampering the use and application of geostatistics. We therefore present GSTools, a Python-based software suite for solving a wide range of geostatistical problems. We chose Python due to its unique balance between usability, flexibility, and efficiency and due to its adoption in the scientific community. GSTools provides methods for generating random fields, it can perform kriging and variogram estimation and much more. We demonstrate its abilities by virtue of a series of example application detailing their use.}},

These targets often correspond to point-wise, man-made objects widely available over a city, but less present in non-urban areas. To overcome the limits of PSInSAR, analysis of interferometric data-stacks should aim at extracting geophysical parameters not only from point-wise deterministic objects (i.e., PS), but also from distributed scatterers (DS). Rather than developing hybrid processing chains where two or more algorithms are applied to the same data-stack, and results are then combined, in this paper we introduce a new approach, SqueeSAR, to jointly process PS and DS, taking into account their different statistical behavior. As it will be shown, PS and DS can be jointly processed without the need for significant changes to the traditional PSInSAR processing chain and without the need to unwrap hundreds of interferograms, provided that the coherence matrix associated with each DS is properly “squeezed” to provide a vector of optimum (wrapped) phase values. Results on real SAR data, acquired over an Alpine area, challenging for any InSAR analysis, confirm the effectiveness of this new approach.}},

At each snow-covered satellite footprint, the technique computes a snow depth increment as the weighted average of data increments, and updates the satellite-derived snow depth accordingly. Data increments are computed as the difference between the in-situ-measured and satellite snow depth at station locations surrounding the satellite footprint. Calculation of optimal weights is based on spatial lag autocorrelation of snow depth increments, modelled as functions of horizontal distance and elevation difference between pairs of observations. The technique is applied to Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) snow depth and in-situ snow depth obtained from the Global Historical Climatology Network. The results over North America during January–February 2017 indicate that the technique greatly enhances the performance of the satellite estimates, especially over mountain terrain, albeit with an accuracy inferior to that over low elevation areas. Moreover, the technique generates more accurate output compared to that from NOAA’s Global Forecast System, with implications for improving the utilization of satellite data in snow assessments and numerical weather prediction.}},

Airborne lidar is the current gold standard for snow depth measurement, but it involves high costs and relatively limited coverage. Using very‐high‐resolution satellite stereo images from WorldView‐2, WorldView‐3, and Pléiades‐HR 1A/1B, we produced a six‐year time series (2017–2022) of spatially continuous digital elevation models for an 874 km2 study area over Grand Mesa, Colorado. We generated high‐resolution stereo snow depth maps that capture intra‐ and interannual variability and span multiple anomalous years (58\%–158\% of median peak SNOTEL snow depth). Comparisons with near‐contemporaneous airborne lidar snow depth measurements showed good agreement, with median offset of −0.13 m, precision of 0.19 m and accuracy of 0.31 m. Our results suggest that satellite stereo can provide snow depth observations with the spatiotemporal coverage needed to improve operational forecast models and inform adaptive management strategies. Detailed observations of snow depth can help us better understand how much water is stored as snow during important times of the year. We used high‐resolution images from commercial satellites to create detailed maps of snow‐covered surfaces for a study site in Colorado. Using a technique called stereo photogrammetry, we created precise three‐dimensional models of surface elevation from these images. By subtracting a snow‐free summer ground surface model from the winter snow surface models, we estimated snow depth over large areas and multiple years. Our satellite snow depth estimates agreed with snow depth measurements from airborne lidar and field campaigns. This satellite stereo approach helps us understand how mountain snow depth varies from year to year, providing valuable information to improve models and decisions for water resources management.

The optical satellite data are based on the mean surface albedo from the Satellite Application Facility for Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) CLouds, Albedo and RAdiation second release Surface ALbedo (CLARA‐A2 SAL) data set. The microwave satellite data are based on temporal variations in the differences of the brightness temperature from satellite passive microwave radiometers. The analysis shows that the microwave‐based method detects melt onset on average 10 days later than the albedo‐based method, which results from the different melt detection methods; the albedo‐based method observes the point when the spring snow metamorphism begins to have a detectable effect on snow albedo, whereas the microwave‐based method detects the appearance of meltwater in snowpack. The difference in MOD decreases in forests, because canopy protects snow from sunlight delaying snow metamorphism. Additionally, we analyzed the MOD estimates for trends across the Northern Hemisphere and separately for Eurasia and North America. A statistically significant negative trend toward earlier melt onset exists in all cases, which is consistent with previous studies.

The distribution of liquid water in snow is commonly estimated from point measurements using a "hand" squeeze test, or a dielectric device such as a "Snow Fork" or a "Denoth meter". Here we compare estimates of water content in the Swiss Alps made using the hand test to those made with a Snow Fork and a Denoth meter. Measurements were conducted in the Swiss Alps, mostly above tree line; more than 12 000 measurements were made at 85 locations over 30 days. Results show that the hand test generally over estimates the volumetric liquid water content. Estimates using the Snow Fork are generally 1 \% higher than those derived from the Denoth meter. The measurements were also used to investigate temporal and small-scale spatial patterns of wetness. Results show that typically a single point measurement does not characterize the wetness of the surrounding snow. Large diurnal changes in wetness are common in the near-surface snow, and associated changes at depth were also observed. A single vertical profile of measurements is not sufficient to determine whether these changes were a result of a spatially homogeneous wetting front or caused by infiltration through pipes. Based on our observations, we suggest that three measurements at horizontal distances greater than 50 cm are needed to adequately characterize the distribution of liquid water through a snowpack. Further, we suggest a simplified classification scheme that includes five wetness patterns that incorporate both the vertical and horizontal distribution of liquid water in a snowpack.}},

The classes can also be derived using a binary system of three climate variables: wind, precipitation, and air temperature. Using this classification system, the Northern Hemisphere distribution of the snow cover classes is mapped on a 0.5° lat × 0.5° long grid. These maps are compared to maps prepared from snow cover data collected in the former Soviet Union and Alaska. For these areas where both climatologically based and texturally based snow cover maps are available, there is 62\% and 90\% agreement, respectively. Five of the six snow classes are found in Alaska. From 1989 through 1992, hourly measurements, consisting of 40 thermal and physical parameters, including snow depth, the temperature distribution in the snow, and basal heat flow, were made on four of these classes. In addition, snow stratigraphy and texture were measured every six weeks. Factor analysis indicates that the snow classes can be readily discriminated using four or more winter average thermal or physical parameters. Further, analysis of hourly time series indicates that 84\% of the time, spot measurements of the parameters are sufficient to correctly differentiate the snow cover class. Using the new snow classification system, 1) classes can readily be distinguished using observations of simple thermal parameters, 2) physical and thermal attributes of the snow can be inferred, and 3) classes can be mapped from climate data for use in regional and global climate modeling.}},

With polar bears (Ursus maritimus), the technique has only proven effective on landscapes with little topographic relief that are devoid of snow and ice, and time‐consuming manual review of imagery is required to identify bears. Here, we evaluated mechanisms to further develop methods for satellite imagery by examining data from Rowley Island, Canada. We attempted to automate and expedite detection via a supervised spectral classification and image differencing to expedite image review. We also assessed what proportion of a region should be sampled to obtain reliable estimates of density and abundance. Although the spectral signature of polar bears differed from nontarget objects, these differences were insufficient to yield useful results via a supervised classification process. Conversely, automated image differencing—or subtracting one image from another—correctly identified nearly 90\% of polar bear locations. This technique, however, also yielded false positives, suggesting that manual review will still be required to confirm polar bear locations. On Rowley Island, bear distribution approximated a Poisson distribution across a range of plot sizes, and resampling suggests that sampling >50\% of the site facilitates reliable estimation of density (CV <15\%). Satellite imagery may be an effective monitoring tool in certain areas, but large‐scale applications remain limited because of the challenges in automation and the limited environments in which the method can be effectively applied.

Since each of these submodels was originally developed and tested for nonforested conditions, details describing modifications made to the submodels for forested areas are provided.

Conceptually, SnowModel includes the first-order physics required to simulate snow evolution within each of the global snow classes (i.e., ice, tundra, taiga, alpine/mountain, prairie, maritime, and ephemeral). The required model inputs are 1) temporally varying fields of precipitation, wind speed and direction, air temperature, and relative humidity obtained from meteorological stations and/or an atmospheric model located within or near the simulation domain; and 2) spatially distributed fields of topography and vegetation type.

Maps depicting relative change in phase and the theoretical relative change in SWE between satellite acquisitions are created for 3-day periods at the end of March 1994 using both ascending and descending ERS-1 overpasses. The theoretical coefficient relating relative change in phase and relative change in SWE for C-band is found to be at least twice as large as what is expected when using a simple single-layer snow model for this study area and time period. Without any direct measurements of SWE on the ground, station measurements of snow depth and hourly wind are linked to each 3-day relative change in phase map. Along with a qualitative assessment, quantitative measures of the rate and magnitude of phase change around these stations are directly compared to the hourly wind data for a given 3-day period. InSAR-derived maps acquired around a measured precipitation event show a considerable relationship to the predominant direction of strong winds over each 3-day period while maps acquired around no measureable precipitation depict much less correlation between phase change and predominant direction of strong winds. Despite limited ground measurements to infer snowpack conditions, these results show continued promise for the InSAR technique to measure changes in snowpack conditions (e.g. SWE) at much higher resolutions than manual sampling methods or passive microwave remote sensing. The extension of this technique to current L-band InSAR satellite platforms is also discussed.}},

Parameterization choices naturally span a wide range of complexities. In this study, we evaluate the performance of different snow model parameterizations for hydrological applications using an existing multimodel energy‐balance framework and data from two well‐instrumented alpine sites with seasonal snow cover. We also include two temperature‐index snow models and an intensive, physically based multilayer snow model in our analyses. Our results show that snow mass observations provide useful information for evaluating the ability of a model to predict snowpack runoff, whereas snow depth data alone are not. For snow mass and runoff, the energy‐balance models appear transferable between our two study sites, a behavior which is not observed for snow surface temperature predictions due to site‐specificity of turbulent heat transfer formulations. Errors in the input and validation data, rather than model formulation, seem to be the greatest factor affecting model performance. The three model types provide similar ability to reproduce daily observed snowpack runoff when appropriate model structures are chosen. Model complexity was not a determinant for predicting daily snowpack mass and runoff reliably. Our study shows the usefulness of the multimodel framework for identifying appropriate models under given constraints such as data availability, properties of interest and computational cost.

This paradigm faces an impending challenge given consensus that a smaller fraction of future precipitation will fall as snow. Here, we apply downscaled hydrologic simulations from 28 climate model projections to show that by mid-century (2036–2065), 69\% of historically snowmelt-dominated areas of the western United States see a decline in the ability of snow to predict seasonal drought, increasing to 83\% by late century (2070–2099). Reduced predictability arises when peak snowpack approaches zero or because of decreased warm-season runoff efficiency. Changes in drought prediction skill show significant (P < 0.01) elevation dependence, with lower-elevation coastal areas most impacted by warming. Ancillary predictive information can only partially mitigate snow-based predictability losses to 65\% of areas, underscoring the importance of declining future snowpack. Climate warming causes less mountain precipitation to fall as snow. Hydrologic simulations predict that in a high-end emissions scenario, this decreases the predictability of seasonal water resources across the western United States, with low-elevation coastal areas impacted most strongly.}},

SNOWPACK uses measured snow depths to determine snow precipitation rates via the calculated settling rates. This requires a rigid data control algorithm. A new statistical model is used to estimate fresh snow density as a function of the measured atmospheric conditions. A statistical model is also derived for the snow albedo, which is necessary to determine the absorbed radiation. The surface sensible and latent heat flux parameterizations are derived from Monin–Obukhov similarity and include a formulation for wind pumping. The formulations will also adapt to drifting snow conditions. The new suggestion is consistent with the observation of different roughness lengths for scalars and momentum over snow. An accurate formulation, especially for the latent heat exchange, is crucial because latent heat exchange determines the formation of surface hoar, a very important weak layer. We also account for the effect of wind pumping on the thermal conductivity in the uppermost snow layers. The surface energy and mass exchange formulations are evaluated by looking at the formation of the important thin layers surface hoar and melt–freeze crusts in SNOWPACK. Those layers are well simulated. In addition, the complete snow profile development is modeled successfully for the parameters grain type, temperature, density, grain size and liquid water content. An overall score between 0 and 1 is used to describe the profile agreement with observations and an average score of over 0.8 is reached.}},

abstract = {{Snow density is one of the important indicators of snow cover hydrological potential. The application of existing algorithms for retrieving dry snow density using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is limited by single scattering mechanism, small terrain fluctuation or narrow incidence angle range. In the study, an improved approach was proposed to retrieve dry snow density from C-band SAR data with a wide range of roughness and local incidence angles. Both the snow-ground interface scattering and volume scattering were considered in the approach. First, the relationship between the backscattering at the snow-ground interface and relative permittivity was obtained based on simulation using the Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) and regression analysis. Then the classical relationship between the volume backscattering and relative permittivity obtained by the first-order volume scattering model was incorporated into the approach. For comparison, the coefficients of the Shi algorithm were redefined by the AIEM model and regression analysis, and the Shi algorithm initially developed for L-band was modified for C-band. In experiments, the RADARSAT-2 data obtained in the Manasi River Basin on December 12–17, 2013 and the C-band GaoFen-3 data obtained in the Kelan River Basin on January 17, 2018 were selected to validate the applicability of the proposed approach under different conditions. The inversion results in the Manasi River Basin using the proposed approach, Singh algorithm, and modified Shi algorithm were compared. The results in the Manasi River Basin show that the correlation coefficients (Rs) between the measured and estimated dry snow density are 0.868, 0.694, and 0.653 for the three methods, respectively. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 31.1 kg m−3, 59.1 kg m−3, and 64.7 kg m−3, respectively, and the mean relative errors (MREs) are 12.9\%, 21.9\%, and 25.5\%, respectively. The corresponding R, RMSE, and MRE in the Kelan River Basin using the proposed approach are 0.717, 57.2 kg m−3, and 27.1\%, respectively. The results prove that the dry snow density under different C-band SAR data and different areas can be effectively retrieved using the proposed approach superior to the other two algorithms.}},

Numerous studies point to the threat global warming poses to the timing and magnitude of snow accumulation and melt. But analyses focused on snow supply do not show where changes to snowmelt runoff are likely to present the most pressing adaptation challenges, given sub-annual patterns of human water consumption and water availability from rainfall. We identify the NH basins where present spring and summer snowmelt has the greatest potential to supply the human water demand that would otherwise be unmet by instantaneous rainfall runoff. Using a multi-model ensemble of climate change projections, we find that these basins—which together have a present population of \textbackslashtextasciitilde2 billion people—are exposed to a 67\% risk of decreased snow supply this coming century. Further, in the multi-model mean, 68 basins (with a present population of >300 million people) transition from having sufficient rainfall runoff to meet all present human water demand to having insufficient rainfall runoff. However, internal climate variability creates irreducible uncertainty in the projected future trends in snow resource potential, with about 90\% of snow-sensitive basins showing potential for either increases or decreases over the near-term decades. Our results emphasize the importance of snow for fulfilling human water demand in many NH basins, and highlight the need to account for the full range of internal climate variability in developing robust climate risk management decisions.}},

We evaluate a suite of 230,000 model realizations at the snow monitoring station Kühtai (Tyrol, Austria, 1,920 m above sea level) against snow water equivalent observations. The results show throughout the course of 25 winter seasons (1991–2015) and different model performance criteria a large influence of forcing data uncertainty and its interactions on the model performance. Mean interannual total sensitivity indices are in the general order of parameter choice < model structure < forcing error, with precipitation, air temperature, and the radiative forcings controlling the variance during the accumulation period and air temperature and longwave irradiance controlling the variance during the ablation period, respectively. Model skill is highly sensitive to the snowpack liquid water transport scheme throughout the whole winter period and to albedo representation during the ablation period. We found a sufficiently long evaluation period (>10 years) is required for robust averaging. A considerable interaction effect was revealed, indicating that an improvement in the knowledge (i.e., reduction of uncertainty) of one factor alone might not necessarily improve model results. Snow models are most sensitive to input data errors then to model structure and last to model parameters Sensitivity analyses of complex snow models must include interaction effects for a representative assessment Sensitivities are variable between winter seasons, and a long period needs to be evaluated for robust averages}},

abstract = {{Snow water equivalent (SWE) is a critical input for weather, climate, and water resource management models at local to global scales. Despite its importance, global SWE measurements that are accurate, consistent, and at sufficiently high spatiotemporal resolutions are not currently available. L-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques have been used to measure SWE at local to regional scales, and two upcoming L-band SAR satellite missions have renewed interest in these techniques to provide regular SWE measurements at the global scale. However, previous research demonstrating the capabilities of L-band InSAR-SWE measurement has been limited to mountain or tundra snowpack regimes. Here we examine the feasibility of applying the same techniques over a prairie snowpack, which are typically characterized by shallow snow depths (mean snow depth of 0.22 m in this study), exposed agricultural vegetation, and high spatial variability over short distances. Our study area in central Montana, USA (47.060, -109.951) was a validation site for NASA SnowEx 2021, as part of the UAVSAR snow timeseries. Airborne L-band SAR imagery was acquired by the UAVSAR platform while concurrent snow measurements were collected using uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-based LiDAR, UAV-based photogrammetry, and ground-based manual techniques. This validation dataset enables an investigation of the effects of sub-pixel snow cover heterogeneity and exposed agricultural vegetation stubble on SAR data and the resulting SWE estimations. Results based on repeated application of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test show that UAVSAR VV phase change is sensitive to differences in snow cover but relatively unaffected by differences in agricultural stubble height. However, we did not find similarly definitive results when we used the same phase change data to estimate SWE. Although broad spatial patterns were similar in both LiDAR-derived and InSAR-derived SWE estimates, considerable differences in the two estimates were apparent in areas with large sub-pixel snow depth variability. Our results indicate that additional work is necessary to derive accurate SWE estimates in prairie environments. Regular measurements from L-band SAR satellites will provide an excellent opportunity to refine InSAR-based snow estimation techniques over shallow, heterogeneous snowpacks.}},

An implicit, finite-difference method suggests that a bulk diffusivity of ∼25±3 m2 a–1 is the most reasonable for representing macroscale heat transport in the top 30 m of firn and snow. This value represents an average diffusivity and, in a conduction-only model, generates temperature series whose phase shifts with depth most closely match those of the Summit borehole data (rms difference between measurements and model output is ∼6 days).

During a week in August 2011 we located repeating infrasound events, peaked in energy between 1 and 10Hz, originating from at least five independent geothermal features, including the episodically erupting Great Fountain, Fountain and Kaleidoscope Geysers, as well as periodic infrasound from nearby Botryoidal and persistent sound from Firehole Spring. Although activity from nearby cone-type geysers was not detected in the infrasound band up through 50Hz, the major fountain-type geysers (i.e., with columns greater than 10m) could be detected at several kilometers, and two minor geysers (i.e., a few meters in eruption height) could be tracked at distances up to a few hundred meters. Detection of geyser activity was especially comprehensive at night when ambient noise was low. We conclude that infrasound monitoring of fountain-type geysers permits convenient tracking of geyser activity, episodicity, signal duration, energy content, and spectral content. These parameters enable objective statistical quantification of geyser behavior and changes over time that may be due to external forcing.

These hydroclimatic changes are associated with increases in cold‐season days above freezing and decreases in the cold‐season snow‐to‐precipitation ratio. The changes in the temperature and precipitation regime in turn result in shifts toward earlier snowmelt, base flow, and runoff dates throughout the region, as well as reduced annual and warm‐season snowmelt and runoff. The simulated hydrologic response is dominated by changes in temperature, with the ensemble members exhibiting varying trends in cold‐season precipitation over the next three decades but consistent negative trends in cold‐season freeze days, cold‐season snow‐to‐precipitation ratio, and 1 April snow water equivalent.

While this fact is widely known, the use of patterns in modeling snow cover distribution is limited. Here, on the basis of a training set of nine annual snow depth surveys from a small tundra basin in Alaska, we identify the climatological snow distribution pattern (CSDP). Using this and a few depth measurements, the snow distribution for years that were not included in the training set is predicted and mapped with a near-zero bias and RMSE that ranged from 4.4 to 10.4 cm. The accuracy of this strictly empirical approach to modeling the depth distribution is similar to, or better than, the output from a weather-driven physically based snow model. However, in our view a hybrid approach is best. Ingesting the CSDP into SnowModel, a widely used numerical code that simulates snow processes, the accuracy of the model output is improved by up to 60\%. This hybrid approach retains the advantages of running a weather-driven numerical code but adds spatial accuracy currently only obtainable from observed snow patterns. The patterns can be captured in several ways, including aerial photography or satellite remote sensing during snowmelt.}},

A review of snow models, however, shows that many of them draw on a relatively small number of process parameterizations combined in different configurations and using different parameter values. A single model that combines existing parameterizations of differing complexity in many different configurations to generate large ensembles of simulations is presented here. The model is driven and evaluated with data from four winters at an alpine site in France. Consideration of errors in simulations of snow mass, snow depth, albedo and surface temperature show that there is no “best” model, but there is a group of model configurations that give consistently good results, another group that give consistently poor results, and many configurations that give good results in some cases and poor results in others. There is no clear link between model complexity and performance, but the most consistent results come from configurations that have prognostic representations of snow density and albedo and that take some account of storage and refreezing of liquid water within the snow.}},

With ongoing climate change, the frequency and types of snow avalanches may change, affecting the rates of avalanche burial and survival. With a wetter and warmer snow climate, consequences of burial may become more severe. In this review, we assess the potential effects of climate change on the frequency and characteristics of avalanches. We then discuss how these changes might affect the survival rates of subjects buried by avalanches and might influence the responses of search and rescue (SAR) teams and health care providers. While climate change is inevitable, the effects on avalanches remain elusive. The frequency of human triggered avalanches may not change, because this depends largely on the number and behavior of winter recreationists. Blunt trauma and secondary injuries will likely become more frequent as terrain roughness is expected to rise and snow cover to become thinner. Higher snow densities in avalanche debris will likely interfere with the respiration of completely buried victims. Asphyxia and trauma, as causes of avalanche death, may increase. It is unlikely that SAR and health care providers involved in avalanche rescue will have to change their strategies in areas where they are already established. The effects of climate change might foster the expansion of mitigation strategies and the establishment of mountain rescue services in areas subject to increased avalanche hazards caused by changes in snow cover and land use.}},

Using standard array processing techniques, we compared the infrasound source back azimuths with the avalanche flow path identified by frame‐differenced, geo‐referenced video. Results show that infrasound records begin with direct arrivals followed by echoes from the avalanche‐triggering explosions and these decay within 35 s of the detonations. Subsequent infrasound, which lasts 20–30 s, could then be attributed exclusively to the avalanche. These infrasound detections, and their triangulated source locations, progress downhill over time and the most intense infrasound appears to originate from a steep, mid‐path cliff band, where the avalanche reached speeds in excess of 30 m/s and accelerations of more than 5 m/s2. The recorded infrasound was compared to two candidate source models extracted from video: total flow motion and advancing flow motion. Advancing source locations were compared to acoustic intensity time series using a nonnegative least squares inversion to solve for, and to quantify, time‐varying infrasound source intensity. We observed that certain portions of the flow, most notably the early stages and the end stages (when the powder cloud was expanding and settling) were infrasonically quiet. Rapid gravity‐driven flows, such as mud flows, debris flows, and snow avalanches, produce intense infrasound that may be recorded at distances of many kilometers. Infrasound is low‐frequency sounds that are inaudible, but travel long distances efficiently and can be recorded using specialized microphones. This study uses eight microphones distributed around a snow avalanche path to map how the avalanche advances and to quantify which part of the snow avalanche produces the majority of the infrasound. We use a video record of the featured avalanche to confirm findings and determine that much of the sound is created as the avalanche accelerates over a steep cliff band. Lessons learned here can be used to better monitor snow avalanche activity elsewhere including highways that are threatened by avalanches following snowstorms.

The coupled effect of major events and natural phenomena sometimes leads to misinterpretation of interferometric coherence maps and often degrades the performance of change detection algorithms. To differentiate decorrelation sources caused by natural changes from those caused by an event of interest, we formulated a temporal decorrelation model that accounts for the random motion of canopy elements, temporally correlated dielectric changes, and temporally uncorrelated dielectric changes of canopy and ground. The model parameters are extracted from the interferometric pairs associated with natural changes in canopy and ground using the proposed temporal decorrelation model. In addition, the cumulative distribution functions of the temporally uncorrelated model parameters, which are associated with natural changes in canopy and ground, are estimated from interferometric pairs acquired before the event. Model parameters are also extracted from interferometric SAR data acquired across the event and compared with the cumulative probabilities of natural changes in order to calculate the probability of a major event. Subsequently, pixels with cumulative probabilities greater than 75\% are marked as changed due to the event.

Physically based snowpack simulations for historical (1970–1999) and high‐emission scenario (RCP 8.5) mid‐21st century (2050–2079) periods were used to assess changes in the variability of annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWEmax) and SWEmax timing across the western United States. Models show robust declines in the interannual variability of SWEmax in regions where precipitation is projected to increasingly fall as rain. The average frequency of consecutive snow drought years (SWEmax < historical 25th percentile) is projected to increase from 6.6\% to 42.2\% of years. Models also project increases in the variability of SWEmax timing, suggesting reduced reliability of when SWEmax occurs. Differences in physiography and regional climate create distinct spatial patterns of change in snowpack variability that will require adaptive strategies for environmental resource management. A wealth of research has established that warming temperatures associated with climate change in the western United States will generally reduce snowpack accumulation and result in earlier snowmelt timing, with important consequences for water resources and ecosystems. However, changes in the variability of snowpack conditions between years have not been well established. We analyze simulated snowpack data for historical and future climate scenarios and find that changes in variability differ across the western United States. Variability of annual maximum snowpack between years decreases while the timing of peak snow accumulation becomes more variable, particularly in areas transitioning from snow‐ to rain‐dominated precipitation. We also find that consecutive years with very low or early snowpack will become much more frequent. These findings highlight the need to consider changes in snowpack variability in climate change impact assessments and adaptation planning. Interannual variability of peak snowpack amount in the western United States will decrease in regions transitioning from snow to rain Peak snowpack timing will become more interannually variable and occur across a broader range of months Consecutive snow droughts will become much more common across mountains of the western United States}},

The brightness temperature was measured at horizontal and vertical polarization, the backscattering coefficient at HH, VV, HV, and VH polarization, all at incidence angles from 0° to 70°. In addition, we measured soil parameters such as moisture, roughness, and texture. The results are subdivided into three sections. First the microwave parameters measured during two diurnal freeze — thaw cycles of the soil are shown. For thawing the soil has three layers wet/frozen/wet and therefore different microwave properties than for freezing. Second frozen soil (thickness of the frozen layer is larger than the penetration depth of the radiation) is compared with unfrozen soil. For the horizontal polarization we separate the reflectivity into the Fresnel reflectivity and a roughness factor. The active data are compared with the geometrical-optics model at the higher frequencies and with the small-perturbation model at the lower frequencies. In addition the data are used to determine the sensitivity of the microwave parameters to soil liquid water content. Third the growth of a frozen soil layer is monitored. These data are used to test layered media models. Due to the scale height of surface roughness, which is of the order of the penetration depth of the radiation, the models do not agree well with the measurements. We find much better fits with a semiempirical formula.}},

Snow surface melt/freeze cycles, associated with diurnal fluctuations in radiative inputs, are hallmarks of this transition. C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) reliably detects meltwater in the snowpack. Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band SAR offers consistent acquisition patterns that allow for diurnal investigations of melting snow. We used over 50 snow pit observations from 2020 in Grand Mesa, Colorado, USA, to track temperature and wetness in the snowpack as a function of depth and time during snowpack phases of warming, ripening, and runoff. We also ran the physically-based SnowModel, which provided a spatially and temporally continuous independent indication of snowpack conditions. Snowpack phases were identified and corroborated by comparing field measurements with SnowModel outputs. Knowledge of snowpack warming, ripening, and runoff phases was used to interpret diurnal changes in S1 backscatter values. Both field measurements and SnowModel simulations suggested that S1 SAR was not sensitive to the initial snowpack warming phase on Grand Mesa. In the ripening and runoff phases, the diurnal cycle in S1 SAR co-polarized backscatter was affected by both surface melt/freeze as well as the conditions of the snowpack underneath (ripening or ripe). The ripening phase was associated with significant increases in morning backscatter values, likely due to volume scattering from surface melt/freeze crusts, as well as significant decreases in evening backscatter values associated with snowmelt. During the runoff phase, both morning and evening backscatter decreased compared to reference values. These unique S1 diurnal signatures, and their interpretations using field measurements and SnowModel outputs, highlight the capacities and limitations of S1 SAR to understand snow surface states and bulk phases, which may offer runoff forecasting or energy balance model validation or parameterization, especially useful in remote or sparsely-gauged alpine basins.}},

The algorithm is based on the relationship between the SD, the co-polar phase difference (CPD), and particle anisotropy. The Dhundi observatory in the Indian Himalaya was selected as a validation test site where a field campaign was conducted for ground truth measurements in January 2016. Using the field measured values of the snow parameters, the particle anisotropy has been optimized and provided as an input to the SD retrieval algorithm. A spatially variable snow density (ρs) was used for the estimation of the SWE, and a temporal resolution of 90 m was achieved in the inversion process. When the retrieval accuracy was tested for different snowpack conditions, it was found that the proposed algorithm shows good accuracy for recrystallized dry snowpack without distinct layering and low wetness (w). The statistical indices, namely, the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute difference (MAD), and percentage error (PE), were used for the accuracy assessment. The algorithm was able to retrieve SD with an average MAE and RMSE of 6.83 cm and 7.88 cm, respectively. The average MAE and RMSE values for SWE were 17.32 mm and 21.41 mm, respectively.

The RKT is a robust, nonparametric test that provides an increased power of trend detection by grouping data from multiple sites within a given geographic region. The RKT analyses indicated strong, pervasive trends in snowmelt and streamflow timing, which have shifted toward earlier in the year by a median of 2–3 weeks over the 29-yr study period. In contrast, relatively few statistically significant trends were detected using simple linear regression. RKT analyses also indicated that November–May air temperatures increased by a median of 0.9°C decade−1, while 1 April SWE and maximum SWE declined by a median of 4.1 and 3.6 cm decade−1, respectively. Multiple linear regression models were created, using monthly air temperatures, snowfall, latitude, and elevation as explanatory variables to identify major controlling factors on snowmelt timing. The models accounted for 45\% of the variance in snowmelt onset, and 78\% of the variance in the snowmelt center of mass (when half the snowpack had melted). Variations in springtime air temperature and SWE explained most of the interannual variability in snowmelt timing. Regression coefficients for air temperature were negative, indicating that warm temperatures promote early melt. Regression coefficients for SWE, latitude, and elevation were positive, indicating that abundant snowfall tends to delay snowmelt, and snowmelt tends to occur later at northern latitudes and high elevations. Results from this study indicate that even the mountains of Colorado, with their high elevations and cold snowpacks, are experiencing substantial shifts in the timing of snowmelt and snowmelt runoff toward earlier in the year.}},

abstract = {{In many regions, a warming climate may lead to large decreases in annual snowfall while having a much weaker effect on the intensities of the heaviest snowfall events — those that can be most disruptive to urban infrastructure. A warming climate is expected to decrease snowfall dramatically, but will it necessarily reduce the frequency of extremely heavy snow events — those that tend to have the greatest impact on, for example, urban infrastructure and power supplies? Paul O'Gorman shows that by the late twenty-first century, even in a scenario of high emissions of greenhouse gasses, there should be little change in the frequency of heavy snowfall events. O'Gorman links the stability of heavy snow to the presence of a stable threshold between rain and snow, one that is unlikely to be changed by climate warming. The findings suggest that — unlike the case for extreme liquid precipitation — extreme snowfall is unlikely to be a good diagnostic of climate change. Snowfall is an important element of the climate system, and one that is expected to change in a warming climate1,2,3,4. Both mean snowfall and the intensity distribution of snowfall are important, with heavy snowfall events having particularly large economic and human impacts5,6,7. Simulations with climate models indicate that annual mean snowfall declines with warming in most regions but increases in regions with very low surface temperatures3,4. The response of heavy snowfall events to a changing climate, however, is unclear. Here I show that in simulations with climate models under a scenario of high emissions of greenhouse gases, by the late twenty-first century there are smaller fractional changes in the intensities of daily snowfall extremes than in mean snowfall over many Northern Hemisphere land regions. For example, for monthly climatological temperatures just below freezing and surface elevations below 1,000 metres, the 99.99th percentile of daily snowfall decreases by 8\% in the multimodel median, compared to a 65\% reduction in mean snowfall. Both mean and extreme snowfall must decrease for a sufficiently large warming, but the climatological temperature above which snowfall extremes decrease with warming in the simulations is as high as −9 °C, compared to −14 °C for mean snowfall. These results are supported by a physically based theory that is consistent with the observed rain–snow transition. According to the theory, snowfall extremes occur near an optimal temperature that is insensitive to climate warming, and this results in smaller fractional changes for higher percentiles of daily snowfall. The simulated changes in snowfall that I find would influence surface snow and its hazards; these changes also suggest that it may be difficult to detect a regional climate-change signal in snowfall extremes.}},

abstract = {{To better understand the interactions between C-band radar waves and snow, a tower-based experiment was set up in the Idaho Rocky Mountains for the period of 2021–2023. The experiment objective was to improve understanding of the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter radar signals to snow. The data were collected in the time domain to measure the backscatter profile from the various snowpack and ground surface layers. The data show that scattering is present throughout the snow volume, although it is limited for low snow densities. Contrasting layer interfaces, ice features and metamorphic snow can have considerable impact on the backscatter signal. During snow melt periods, wet snow absorbs the signal and the soil backscatter becomes negligible. A comparison of the vertically integrated tower radar data with Sentinel-1 data shows that both systems have a similar temporal behavior, and both feature an increase in backscatter during the dry snow period in 2021–2022, even during weeks of nearly constant snow depth, likely due to morphological changes in the snowpack. The results demonstrate that C-band radar is sensitive to the dominant seasonal patterns in snow accumulation, but that changes in microstructure, stratigraphy, melt-freeze cycles, and snow wetness may complicate satellite-based snow depth retrievals.}},

The algorithms include a new and computationally efficient approach for quantitative assessment of the uncertainty on array measurements based on error propagation theory. We apply the algorithms to new data collected by two 6-element infrasound arrays deployed at Mt. Etna during the period July–August 2019. Our results demonstrate that the use of two infrasound arrays allowed detecting and tracking acoustic sources from multiple craters and active vents associated with degassing and ash-rich explosions, vigorous and frequent Strombolian activity, opening of new eruptive fractures and emplacement of lava flows.

Active and passive microwave remote sensing methods are explored, as local methods cannot be generalized due to the spatial inhomogeneity of the snow pack. Microwaves interact with snow by absorption, scattering, and refraction. For dry snow of a few meters depth and frequencies below 20GHz, absorption and scattering in the snow volume are negligible compared with the backscattered energy from the underlying ground. The signal delay caused by refraction can be measured with differential radar interferometry, but phase wrapping errors and temporal decorrelation must be considered. We demonstrate that large \$\textbackslashDelta\textbackslashtext\{SWE\}\$ can be accurately determined from dense time series of differential interferograms at X- and Ku-band by temporal integration. Lost phase cycles are reconstructed with a two-frequency approach. Temporal decorrelation is minimized by a temporal resolution of 4h.

abstract = {{Seasonal snow cover is the largest single component of the cryosphere in areal extent, covering an average of 46 million square km of Earth's surface (31 \% of the land area) each year, and is thus an important expression of and driver of the Earth’s climate. In recent years, Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has been declining at about the same rate (\textbackslashtextasciitilde −13 \%/decade) as Arctic summer sea ice. More than one-sixth of the world’s population relies on seasonal snowpack and glaciers for a water supply that is likely to decrease this century. Snow is also a critical component of Earth’s cold regions' ecosystems, in which wildlife, vegetation, and snow are strongly interconnected. Snow water equivalent (SWE) describes the quantity of snow stored on the land surface and is of fundamental importance to water, energy, and geochemical cycles. Quality global SWE estimates are lacking. Given the vast seasonal extent combined with the spatially variable nature of snow distribution at regional and local scales, surface observations will not be able to provide sufficient SWE information. Satellite observations presently cannot provide SWE information at the spatial and temporal resolutions required to address science and high socio-economic value applications such as water resource management and streamflow forecasting. In this paper, we review the potential contribution of X- and Ku-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for global monitoring of SWE. We describe radar interactions with snow-covered landscapes, characterization of snowpack properties using radar measurements, and refinement of retrieval algorithms via synergy with other microwave remote sensing approaches. SAR can image the surface during both day and night regardless of cloud cover, allowing high-frequency revisit at high spatial resolution as demonstrated by missions such as Sentinel-1. The physical basis for estimating SWE from X- and Ku-band radar measurements at local scales is volume scattering by millimetre-scale snow grains. Inference of global snow properties from SAR requires an interdisciplinary approach based on field observations of snow microstructure, physical snow modelling, electromagnetic theory, and retrieval strategies over a range of scales. New field measurement capabilities have enabled significant advances in understanding snow microstructure such as grain size, densities, and layering. We describe radar interactions with snow-covered landscapes, the characterization of snowpack properties using radar measurements, and the refinement of retrieval algorithms via synergy with other microwave remote sensing approaches. This review serves to inform the broader snow research, monitoring, and applications communities on progress made in recent decades, and sets the stage for a new era in SWE remote-sensing from SAR measurements.}},

Moreover, the snow density and incident angle parameters were analyzed and calibrated, and the local incident angle was used as a substitute for the satellite incident angle to improve the snow depth estimation. From the results, the coherence images showed that a high degree of coherence can be found for dry snow, and, apart from the effect of snow, land use/cover change due to a long temporal baseline and geometric distortion due to the rugged terrain were the main constraints for InSAR technique to measure snow depth and SWE in this area. The result of snow depth estimation between July 2008 and February 2009 demonstrated that the average snow depth was about 20 cm, which was consistent with the field survey results. The areal coverage of snow distribution estimated from the snow depth and SWE results was consistent with snow cover obtained from HJ-1A CCD optical data at the same time.}},

To date, however, observations of changing SWE or snowmelt have been limited to the state of Colorado in the intermountain west (IMW), defined here as the Rio Grande, Colorado River, and Great Basins, which supply water to the driest regions of North America. We used daily SNOTEL data collected between 1984 and 2009 combined with the nonparametric regional Kendall test to demonstrate significant and widespread changes in the duration of snow cover in these river basins. Daily SNOTEL data demonstrated that basin average maximum SWE occurred as early as 7 March (Lower Colorado River Basin) and as late as 13 April (Upper Colorado, Yampa, and White River Basins). Although significant increases in winter temperature (T) were widespread, there were minimal changes in the day of maximum accumulation and no indications from SWE to winter precipitation ratios (SWE:P) and winter T observations that a transition from snow to rain had occurred. While there was little change in day of maximum accumulation, the duration of snow cover decreased in 11 of 13 drainage regions, and snowmelt center of mass (SM50) advanced 1 to 4 days per decade in 6 of 13 regions. There were significant trends toward a faster SM50 and shorter duration of snow cover in the highest-elevation regions (>2800 m) of the Colorado River Basin, suggesting that winter T and P may not be the primary driver of change. Our results show that the IMW hydroclimate is both spatially and temporally variable, with few changes in winter T and P in the Great Basin and drier and warmer winters in the Colorado River and Rio Grande Basins. The changes in snowmelt timing also were variable, with a shorter SM50 and less maximum SWE in the Colorado River and Rio Grande Basins. The variable response of snowpacks in the IMW to widespread warming highlights the need for additional research into the mass and energy balance of these continental snowpacks.}},

The most important polarimetric distortions in airborne PolSAR data sets are the channel imbalance and crosstalk. The minimization of these polarimetric distortions using polarimetric calibration techniques is very important to carry out the quantitative analysis using PolSAR data and time series analysis and to compare results between different sensors. In the current state of the art, the spatial variability of the polarimetric distortions at different slant‐range positions in the data set was not completely analyzed and also the temporal variability of the polarimetric distortions using multiple data sets needs to be more investigated. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to develop an operational processor to perform the external polarimetric calibration of the L‐band Uninhibited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar system and to analyze the spatio‐temporal behavior of the polarimetric distortions. The polarimetric distortion matrix (PDM) was formulated after considering the crosstalk and channel imbalance polarimetric distortions to derive the scattering matrix free from all kinds of polarimetric distortions from the observed scattering matrix. The Quegan, improved Quegan, and Ainsworth methods for polarimetric calibration were implemented to solve the PDM. The residual channel imbalance and crosstalk after polarimetric calibration were estimated to compare the calibration efficiency of these methods. After that, a spatio‐temporal analysis was carried out with several data sets to assess the spatio‐temporal behavior of these polarimetric distortions. The polarimetric signatures and the coherency matrix behavior of the trihedral corner reflectors were used to analyze the ground target characterization improvement after polarimetric calibration. The results obtained from this study revealed that the crosstalk is the major cause for the polarimetric distortions and the channel imbalance and phase bias present in the data sets were not high. From the spatio‐temporal analysis, it was found that the variability of these polarimetric distortions both in spatial and temporal domains was minimum and can be discarded without causing any considerable error in the polarimetric calibration process.

Various algorithms including the Environment Canada (EC) algorithms, the spectral polarization difference (SPD) algorithm, and an artificial neural network (ANN) for both SSM/I and AMSR-E are evaluated against in situ SWE observations using several statistical metrics. The results show that the EC algorithms developed specifically for the southern prairies and boreal forest perform poorly across the complex topography and generally deep snow of the QRB. For other frequency combinations of SSM/I and AMSR-E measurements, significant relationships between TB difference and in situ SWE exist only when the snow accumulation is less than a threshold of 250 or 400 mm, which varies at the different in situ stations. Overall, AMSR-E provides better estimates of retrieved SWE than SSM/I. Compared to the algorithms based on TB difference, the ANNs for SSM/I and AMSR-E perform much better. The ANNs trained with all channels of AMSR-E have the best performance in fitting SWE and are able to resolve the temporal variations of SWE at all in situ stations.

Four mineral soils with a range of texture from sandy loam to clay were tested. An empirical relationship between the apparent dielectric constant Ka and the volumetric water content θv, which is independent of soil type, soil density, soil temperature, and soluble salt content, can be used to determine θv, from air dry to water saturated, with an error of estimate of 0.013.

We demonstrate the ability of the Sentinel-1 mission to monitor weekly snow depth at sub-kilometer (100 m, 300 m and 1 km) resolutions over the European Alps, for 2017–2019. Sentinel-1 backscatter observations, especially for the cross-polarization channel, show a high correlation with regional model simulations of snow depth over Austria and Switzerland. The observed changes in radar backscatter with the accumulation or ablation of snow are used in a change detection algorithm to retrieve snow depth. The algorithm includes the detection of dry and wet snow conditions. For dry snow conditions, the 1 km Sentinel-1 retrievals have a spatio-temporal correlation (R) of 0.87 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.17 m compared to in situ measurements across 743 sites in the European Alps. A slight reduction in performance is observed for the retrievals at 300 m (R = 0.85 and MAE = 0.18 m) and 100 m (R = 0.79 and MAE = 0.21 m). The results demonstrate the ability of Sentinel-1 to provide regional snow estimates at an unprecedented resolution in mountainous regions, where satellite-based estimates of snow mass are currently lacking.

abstract = {{Detailed information on the spatiotemporal snow depth distribution is a crucial input for numerous applications in hydrology, climatology, ecology and avalanche research. Today, snow depth distribution is usually estimated by combining point measurements from weather stations or observers in the field with spatial interpolation algorithms. However, even a dense measurement network like the one in Switzerland, with more than one measurement station per 10 km2 on average, is not able to capture the large spatial variability of snow depth present in alpine terrain. Remote sensing methods, such as laser scanning or digital photogrammetry, have recently been successfully applied to map snow depth variability at local and regional scales. However, in most countries such data acquisition is costly if manned airplanes are involved. The effectiveness of ground-based measurements on the other hand is often hindered by occlusions, due to the complex terrain or acute viewing angles. In this paper, we investigate the application of unmanned aerial systems (UASs), in combination with structure-from-motion photogrammetry, to map snow depth distribution. Compared to manual measurements, such systems are relatively cost-effective and can be applied very flexibly to cover terrain not accessible from the ground. In this study, we map snow depth at two different locations: (a) a sheltered location at the bottom of the Flüela valley (1900 m a.s.l.) and (b) an exposed location on a peak (2500 m a.s.l.) in the ski resort Jakobshorn, both in the vicinity of Davos, Switzerland. At the first test site, we monitor the ablation on three different dates. We validate the photogrammetric snow depth maps using simultaneously acquired manual snow depth measurements.

With the analysis of ancillary data, a snow increase process and a snow decrease process were determined. Then, the multiple temporal-coherence components were used to study the variation of thawing and freezing statuses of snow because the components can mostly reflect the temporal change of the snow that occurred between two data acquisitions. Compared with snow mapping results derived from optical images, the outcomes from the snow increase process and the snow decrease process reached an overall accuracy of 71.3\% and 79.5\%, respectively.

We use a particle batch smoother to leverage satellite information from Sentinel-1 derived snow depth retrievals and to correct various gridded precipitation products. This novel approach is tested using a simple snow model for an alpine basin located in Trentino Alto Adige, Italy. We quantify the precipitation biases across the basin and found that the assimilation method (i) corrects for snowfall biases and uncertainties, (ii) leads to cumulative snowfall elevation patterns that are consistent across precipitation products, and (iii) results in overall improved basin-wide snow variables (snow depth and snow cover area) and basin streamflow estimates.}},

However, atmospheric artifacts due to spatial and temporal variations of the atmospheric state often affect the reliability and accuracy of its results. The commonly-known Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS) appears in the interferograms as ghost fringes not related to either topography or deformation. Atmospheric artifact mitigation remains one of the biggest challenges to be addressed within the DInSAR community. State-of-the-art research works have revealed that atmospheric artifacts can be partially compensated with empirical models, point-wise GPS zenith path delay, and numerical weather prediction models. In this study, we implement an accurate and realistic computing strategy using atmospheric reanalysis ERA5 data to estimate atmospheric artifacts. With this approach, the Line-of-Sight (LOS) path along the satellite trajectory and the monitored points is considered, rather than estimating it from the zenith path delay. Compared with the zenith delay-based method, the key advantage is that it can avoid errors caused by any anisotropic atmospheric phenomena. The accurate method is validated with Sentinel-1 data in three different test sites: Tenerife island (Spain), Almería (Spain), and Crete island (Greece). The effectiveness and performance of the method to remove APS from interferograms is evaluated in the three test sites showing a great improvement with respect to the zenith-based approach.}},

abstract = {{The main objective of this study was to monitor wet snow conditions from Sentinel-1 over a season, to examine its variation over time by cross-checking wet snow with independent snow and weather estimates, and to study its distribution taking into account terrain characteristics such as elevation, orientation, and slope. One of our motivations was to derive useful representations of daily or seasonal snow changes that would help to easily identify wet snow elevations and determine melt-out days in an area of interest. In this work, a well-known approach in the literature is used to estimate the extent of wet snow cover continuously over a season and an analysis of the influence of complex mountain topography on snow distribution is proposed taking into account altitude, slope, and aspect of the terrain. The Sentinel-1 wet snow extent product was compared with Sentinel-2 snow products for cloud free scenes. We show that while there are good agreements between the two satellite products, differences exist, especially in areas of forests and glaciers where snow is underestimated. This underestimation must be considered alongside the areas of geometric distortion that were excluded from our study. We analysed retrievals at the scale of our study area by examining wet snow Altitude–Orientation diagrams for different classes of slopes and also wet snow Altitude–Time diagrams for different classes of orientations. We have shown that this type of representation is very useful to get an overview of the snow distribution as it allows to identify very easily wet snow lines for different orientations. For an orientation of interest, the Altitude–Time diagrams can be used to track the evolution of snow to locate altitudes and dates of snow loss. We also show that ascending/descending Sentinel-1 image time series are complementary to monitor wet snow over the French alpine areas to highlight wet snow altitude ranges and identify melt-out days. Links have also been made between Sentinel-1 responses (wet snow) and snow/meteorological events carefully listed over the entire 2017–2018 season.}},

Carbon monoxide was selected as the tracer gas for having essentially the same density as air, low background concentration, low water solubility, and for being detectable to ≤ 1 ppmv with small, low‐cost, low‐power sensors. The plume of 1\% CO injections 30 cm below the snow surface was monitored using 28 sensors (4 locations, 7 depths).

The critical role of snow in water supply has been frequently quantified using the ratio of snowmelt‐derived runoff to total runoff. However, current estimates of the fraction of annual runoff generated by snowmelt are not based on systematic analyses. Here based on hydrological model simulations and a new snowmelt tracking algorithm, we show that 53\% of the total runoff in the western United States originates as snowmelt, despite only 37\% of the precipitation falling as snow. In mountainous areas, snowmelt is responsible for 70\% of the total runoff. By 2100, the contribution of snowmelt to runoff will decrease by one third for the western U.S. in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. Snowmelt‐derived runoff currently makes up two thirds of the inflow to the region's major reservoirs. We argue that substantial impacts on water supply are likely in a warmer climate.

Snow accumulation and melt vary over a broad range of spatial scales, preventing accurate extrapolation of sparse in situ observations to watershed scales. The lidar onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation, Satellite (ICESat-2) was designed for precise mapping of ice sheets and sea ice, and here we assess the feasibility of snow depth-mapping using ICESat-2 data in more complex and rugged mountain landscapes. We explore the utility of ATL08 Land and Vegetation Height and ATL06 Land Ice Height differencing from reference elevation datasets in two end member study sites. We analyze ∼3 years of data for Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed in Idaho's Owyhee Mountains and Wolverine Glacier in southcentral Alaska's Kenai Mountains. Our analysis reveals decimeter-scale uncertainties in derived snow depth and glacier mass balance at the watershed scale. Both accuracy and precision decrease as slope increases: the magnitudes of the median and median of the absolute deviation of elevation errors (MAD) vary from ∼0.2 m for slopes <5° to >1 m for slopes >20°. For glacierized regions, failure to account for intra- and inter-annual evolution of glacier surface elevations can strongly bias ATL06 elevations, resulting in under-estimation of the mass balance gradient with elevation. Based on these results, we conclude that ATL08 and ATL06 observations are best suited for characterization of watershed-scale snow depth and mass balance gradients over relatively shallow slopes with thick snowpacks. In these regions, ICESat-2 elevation residual-derived snow depth and mass balance transects can provide valuable watershed scale constraints on terrain parameter- and model-derived estimates of snow accumulation and melt.}},

This controlled study at the Harry W. Morrison Dam (HWMD) on the Boise River, Idaho, explores how temporal variation in fluvial systems affects surrounding acoustic and seismic fields. Adjusting the configuration of the HWMD changed the river bathymetry and therefore the form of the standing wave below the dam. The HWMD was adjusted to generate four distinct wave regimes that were parameterized through their dimensionless Froude numbers (Fr) and observations of the ambient seismic and acoustic wavefields at the study site. To generate detectable and coherent signals, a standing wave must exceed a threshold Fr value of 1.7, where a nonbreaking undular jump turns into a breaking weak hydraulic jump. Hydrodynamic processes may partially control the spectral content of the seismic and acoustic energies. Furthermore, spectra related to reproducible wave conditions can be used to calibrate and verify fluvial seismic and acoustic models. For detectable and coherent seismoacoustic energies to be generated, a standing wave must exceed a threshold Fr value of approximately 1.7 Hydrodynamic processes may partially control the spectral content of the seismic and acoustic energies Variations in the width and amplitude of seismoacoustic spectral peaks may be explained by horizontal variations across a hydraulic jump}},

Based on an analysis of the signal arrival times and backazimuths at each array, we find that the infrasound arrivals at six arrays can be associated to the same source and that the source location is consistent with the earthquake epicentre. Results of propagation modelling indicate that the lack of associated arrivals at the remaining three arrays is due to path effects. Based on these findings we form the working hypothesis that the infrasound is generated by body waves causing the epicentral region to pump the atmosphere, akin to a baffled piston. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a numerical seismoacoustic model to simulate the generation of epicentral infrasound from earthquakes. We model the generation of seismic waves using a 3‐D finite difference algorithm that accounts for the earthquake moment tensor, source time function, depth and local geology. The resultant acceleration–time histories on a 2‐D grid at the surface then provide the initial conditions for modelling the near‐field infrasonic pressure wave using the Rayleigh integral. Finally, we propagate the near‐field source pressure through the Ground‐to‐Space atmospheric model using a time‐domain Parabolic Equation technique. By comparing the resultant predictions with the six epicentral infrasound observations from the 2011 January 3, Circleville earthquake, we show that the observations agree well with our predictions. The predicted and observed amplitudes are within a factor of 2 (on average, the synthetic amplitudes are a factor of 1.6 larger than the observed amplitudes). In addition, arrivals are predicted at all six arrays where signals are observed, and importantly not predicted at the remaining three arrays. Durations are typically predicted to within a factor of 2, and in some cases much better. These results suggest that measured infrasound from the Circleville earthquake is consistent with the generation of infrasound from body waves in the epicentral region.}},

In Alaska, we use airborne altimetry from 116 glaciers to estimate a regional mass balance of −75 ± 11 Gt yr−1 (1994–2013). Our glacier sample is spatially well distributed, yet pervasive variability in mass balances obscures geospatial and climatic relationships. However, for the first time, these data allow the partitioning of regional mass balance by glacier type. We find that tidewater glaciers are losing mass at substantially slower rates than other glaciers in Alaska and collectively contribute to only 6\% of the regional mass loss.

At this horizontal resolution, the spatiotemporal distribution of the orographic snowfall and snowpack is well captured partly due to the ability of the model to realistically simulate mesoscale and microphysical features such as orographically induced updrafts driving clouds and precipitation. The historical simulation well captures the observed snowfall and snowpack amounts and pattern in the western U.S. The future climate simulation uses the Pseudo-Global Warming approach, taking the climate change signal from CMIP5 multi-model ensemble-mean difference between 2070–2099 and 1976–2005. The results show that the thermodynamic impacts of climate change in the western U.S. can be characterized considering mountain ranges in two distinct geographic regions: the mountain ranges close to the Pacific Ocean (coastal ranges) and those in the inter-mountain west. Climate change out to 2100 significantly impacts all aspects of the water cycle, with pronounced climate change response in the coastal ranges. A notable result is that the snowpack in the Pacific Northwest is predicted to decrease by \textbackslashtextasciitilde 70\% by 2100. Trends of this magnitude have already been observed in the historical data and in previous studies. The current Pseudo Global Warming future climate simulation and previous global climate simulations all suggest that these trends will continue to the point that most snowpack will be gone by 2100 in the Pacific Northwest for the most aggressive RCP8.5 climate scenario, even if annual precipitation increases by 10\%. Future work will focus on extending the current convective permitting results to a full climate change simulation allowing for dynamical changes in the flow.}},

Past evaluations of snow mapping accuracy typically relied on satellite data collected at a higher spatial resolution than the data in question. However, these optical data cannot characterize snow cover mapping performance under forest canopies or at the meter scale. Here, we use 3 m spatial resolution snow depth maps collected on 116 d by an aerial laser scanner to validate band ratio and spectral-mixture snow cover mapping algorithms. Such a comprehensive evaluation of sub-canopy snow mapping performance has not been undertaken previously. The following standard (produced operationally by an agency) products are evaluated: NASA gap-filled Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD10A1F, NASA gap-filled Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) VNP10A1F, and United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat 8 Level-3 Fractional Snow Covered Area. Two spectral-unmixing approaches are also evaluated: Snow-Covered Area and Grain Size (SCAG) and Snow Property Inversion from Remote Sensing (SPIReS), both of which are gap-filled MODIS products and are also run on Landsat 8. We assess subpixel snow mapping performance while considering the fractional snow-covered area (fSCA), canopy cover, sensor zenith angle, and other variables within six global seasonal snow classes. Metrics are calculated at the pixel and basin scales, including the root-mean-square error (RMSE), bias, and F statistic (a detection measure). The newer MOD10A1F Version 61 and VNP10A1F Version 1 product biases (- 7.1 \%, -9.5 \%) improve significantly when linear equations developed for older products are applied (2.8 \%, -2.7 \%) to convert band ratios to fSCA. The F statistics are unchanged (94.4 \%, 93.1 \%) and the VNP10A1F RMSE improves (18.6 \% to 15.7 \%), while the MOD10A1F RMSE worsens (12.7 \% to 13.7 \%). Consistent with previous studies, spectral-unmixing approaches (SCAG, SPIReS) show lower biases (-0.1 \%, -0.1 \%) and RMSE (12.1 \%, 12.0 \%), with higher F statistics (95.6 \%, 96.1 \%) relative to the band ratio approaches for MODIS. Landsat 8 products are all spectral-mixture methods with low biases (-0.4 \% to 0.3 \%), low RMSE (11.4 \% to 15.8 \%), and high F statistics (97.3 \% to 99.1 \%).

The comparison of in situ to retrieved shows a strong Pearson correlation (R = 0.80) and low RMSE (0.1 m, n = 64) for snow depth change and similar results for SWE change (RMSE = 0.04 m, R = 0.52, n = 57). The comparison between retrieved SWE changes to SnowModel SWE change also showed good correlation (R = 0.60, RMSD = 0.023 m, n = 3.2e6) and especially high correlation for a subset of pixels with no modeled melt and low tree coverage (R = 0.72, RMSD = 0.013 m, n = 6.5e4). Finally, we bin the retrievals for a variety of factors and show decreasing correlation between the modeled and retrieved values for lower elevations, higher incidence angles, higher tree percentages and heights, and greater cumulative melt. This study builds on previous interferometry work by using a full winter season time series of L-band SAR images over a large spatial extent to evaluate the accuracy of SWE change retrievals against both in situ and modeled results and the controlling factors of the retrieval accuracy.}},

The filtering performance of Goldstein and its improved filters is mostly affected by several parameters, such as the noise suppression parameter α, the sliding patch size, and the kernel window size. Yet, the fixed parameters will cause the filtering intensity to mismatch the noise levels of different regions. In this paper, we propose an adaptive patch-based Goldstein filter (AP-Goldstein filter), which takes the pseudo-variation coefficient as the measure of patch homogeneity and adaptively selects the patch sizes in different regions of interferogram. This filter controls the noise suppression parameter α by pseudo-coherence, which is a common and effective indicator applied to filter the interferogram phase. Meanwhile, the previously determined patch size of each pixel is used to confirm the kernel window size at the same region. The proposed and other advanced filters were tested on real and simulated interferograms. The qualitative and quantitative comparison of the experimental results shows that this new method can better restrain the phase noise of interferogram while maintaining the edge detailed information and can improve the automation of filtering.}},

	abstract = {Snow is a critical water resource for the western United States and many regions across the globe. However, our ability to accurately measure and monitor changes in snow mass from satellite remote sensing, specifically its water equivalent, remains a challenge. To confront these challenges, NASA initiated the SnowEx program, a multiyear effort to address knowledge gaps in snow remote sensing. During SnowEx 2020, the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) team acquired an L-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data time series to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of repeat-pass L-band InSAR for tracking changes in snow water equivalent (SWE). The goal was to develop a more comprehensive understanding of where and when L-band InSAR can provide SWE change estimates, allowing the snow community to leverage the upcoming NASA–ISRO (NASA–Indian Space Research Organization) SAR (NISAR) mission. Our study analyzed three InSAR image pairs from the Jemez Mountains, NM, between 12 and 26 February 2020. We developed a snow-focused multi-sensor method that uses UAVSAR InSAR data synergistically with optical fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) information. Combining these two remote sensing datasets allows for atmospheric correction and delineation of snow-covered pixels within the radar swath. For all InSAR pairs, we converted phase change values to SWE change estimates between the three acquisition dates. We then evaluated InSAR-derived retrievals using a combination of fSCA, snow pits, meteorological station data, in situ snow depth sensors, and ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The results of this study show that repeat-pass L-band InSAR is effective for estimating both snow accumulation and ablation with the proper measurement timing, reference phase, and snowpack conditions.},

Airborne lidar is the current gold standard for snow depth measurement, but it involves high costs and relatively limited coverage. Using very‐high‐resolution satellite stereo images from WorldView‐2, WorldView‐3, and Pléiades‐HR 1A/1B, we produced a six‐year time series (2017–2022) of spatially continuous digital elevation models for an 874 km2 study area over Grand Mesa, Colorado. We generated high‐resolution stereo snow depth maps that capture intra‐ and interannual variability and span multiple anomalous years (58\%–158\% of median peak SNOTEL snow depth). Comparisons with near‐contemporaneous airborne lidar snow depth measurements showed good agreement, with median offset of −0.13 m, precision of 0.19 m and accuracy of 0.31 m. Our results suggest that satellite stereo can provide snow depth observations with the spatiotemporal coverage needed to improve operational forecast models and inform adaptive management strategies. Detailed observations of snow depth can help us better understand how much water is stored as snow during important times of the year. We used high‐resolution images from commercial satellites to create detailed maps of snow‐covered surfaces for a study site in Colorado. Using a technique called stereo photogrammetry, we created precise three‐dimensional models of surface elevation from these images. By subtracting a snow‐free summer ground surface model from the winter snow surface models, we estimated snow depth over large areas and multiple years. Our satellite snow depth estimates agreed with snow depth measurements from airborne lidar and field campaigns. This satellite stereo approach helps us understand how mountain snow depth varies from year to year, providing valuable information to improve models and decisions for water resources management.

The water resources community needs accurate snow depth data for improved basin-wide snow depth estimates. The NASA ICESat-2 mission has provided over four years of global satellite laser altimetry measurements since October 2018. Previous studies have shown that standard ICESat-2 data products, when combined with snow-off digital terrain models (DTMs) from airborne laser scanning, have the potential to provide snow depth measurements with varying accuracy depending on factors such as surface slope and canopy cover. In this study we show that ICESat-2 snow depth measurements can be improved with customized data products generated using the SlideRule Earth service. Here we investigate the accuracy of our ICESat-2 SlideRule snow depth method using four years (2019–2022) of reference in situ snow depth measurements and airborne lidar snow depth observations for two watersheds with varying terrain characteristics: the Tuolumne River basin above Hetch Hetchy, CA and the Methow Valley, WA. We observe median differences of −0.14 m (RMSE of 0.18 m) and −0.20 m (RMSE of 0.33 m) between our ICESat-2 snow depth measurements and reference snow depth measurements for the Tuolumne Basin and Methow Valley sites, respectively. While individual ICESat-2 elevation measurements can contain noise, basin-scale aggregation offers robust statistics for snow depth. Differences in accuracy between sites are attributed to terrain characteristics and their spatial distributions. The customized ICESat-2 SlideRule data products used in this study resulted in more accurate median snow depth values, including under canopy, than those found by previous studies using standard ICESat-2 data products in mid-latitude mountainous regions. When combined with snow-off DTMs, the aggregated snow-on ICESat-2 SlideRule observations could provide a new snow depth dataset across the western U.S. and potentially global land surfaces.}},

We present the Snow Property Inversion from Remote Sensing (SPIReS) approach, offering the following improvements: 1) Solutions for grain size and concentrations of light absorbing particles are computed simultaneously; 2) Only snow and snow-free endmembers are employed; 3) Cloud-masking and smoothing are integrated; 4) Similar spectra are grouped together and interpolants are used to reduce computation time. The source codes are available in an open repository. Computation is fast enough that users can process imagery on demand. Validation of retrievals from Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) against WorldView-2/3 and the Airborne Snow Observatory shows accurate detection of snow and estimates of fractional snow cover. Validation of albedo shows low errors using terrain-corrected in situ measurements.

Advances in snow cover mapping have led to increasing accuracy, but unsatisfactory treatment of vegetation's interference when mapping snow has led to maps that have limited utility for water forecasting. Vegetation affects snow mapping because ground surfaces not visible to the satellite produce uncertainty as to whether the ground is snow covered. At nadir, the forest canopy obscures the satellite view below the canopy. At oblique viewing angles, the forest floor is obscured by both the canopy and the projection of tree profiles onto the forest floor. We present a canopy correction method based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery validated with field observations that mitigates geometric and georegistration issues associated with changing satellite acquisition angles in forested areas. The largest effect from a variable viewing zenith angle on the viewable gap fraction in forested areas occurs in moderately forested areas with 30–40\% tree canopy coverage. Cloud cover frequently causes errors in snow identification, with some clouds identified as snow and some snow identified as cloud. A snow‐cloud identification method utilizes a time series of fractional vegetation and rock land‐surface data to flag snow‐cloud identification errors and improve snow‐map accuracy reducing bias by 20\% over previous methods. Together, these contributions to snow‐mapping techniques could advance hydrologic forecasting in forested, snow‐dominated basins that comprise an estimated one fifth of Northern Hemisphere snow‐covered areas. Mapping snow cover extent informs water resources stored in the winter snowpack, providing important information for planning how and when to utilize available water. Tree canopies shield the forest floor and hinder the determination of snow‐covered area in vegetated terrain from above, where satellites view the Earth's surface. Moreover, satellites that scan the surface (like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) are most often not directly overhead, and as the view from the satellite to the surface slants, trees obscure a greater portion of the land surface that a satellite can “see,” especially where trees are tall, adding uncertainty to the satellite‐based maps. This effect is greatest in forests where 30–40\% of the land area is covered by tree canopy and has little effect in very dense forests where most of the forest floor is obscured already. Here we present a method to accommodate the stretched and hidden forest footprint when a satellite is not directly overhead. A new method for identifying snow‐mapping errors caused by clouds is also presented by flagging unusually large changes in the non‐snow surfaces over sequential images. These methodological advancements are important because snow‐melt water comprises a major portion of the water supply in many regions where humans live. The canopy correction methodology improves remotely sensed snow mapping accuracy in forested environments, reducing bias by 20\% A novel cloud detection algorithm that uses fractional vegetation and rock coverage can reduce snow‐cloud identification errors Improved performance over previous snow mapping approaches enable melt out date identification within days of actual snow disappearance}},

We present a scalable approach to map snowmelt runoff onset using Sentinel‐1 synthetic aperture radar data for the past 8 years with 10 m spatial resolution and a median temporal resolution of 3.9 days. A systematic analysis of stratovolcanoes in the Western United States showed that snowmelt runoff onset is strongly dependent on elevation (r = 0.81), with a median runoff onset lapse rate of 4.9 days per 100 m of elevation gain. During the 2015 snow drought, we observed snowmelt runoff onset 25 days early relative to the 2015–2022 median. We document a median shift in snowmelt runoff onset of +2.0 days later in the year per year between 2016 and 2022. Our open‐source tools can be used to create snowmelt runoff onset maps anywhere on Earth. Snowmelt timing is important–knowing when water leaves mountain snowpack is critical for downstream water resource applications like irrigation and hydropower. Snowmelt timing is also affected by regional climate change. However, it is hard to make detailed measurements of when and where snow melts across mountainous regions. We developed an improved method to map snowmelt using satellite based radar data, and we applied this method to study snow on mountains in the Western United States. We documented the detailed relationship between elevation and snowmelt, and how this relationship changed over the past 8 years. In general, at higher elevations and latitudes, snow melts later in the year. We also observed snow melting much earlier than it usually does during the 2015 snow drought, which helps us prepare for future years with low snow accumulation. Finally, from 2016 to 2022, we documented a shift toward snowmelt happening earlier in the year, which means earlier spring flow in rivers. We publicly released interactive, user‐friendly software, so anyone can use our method to study snowmelt timing anywhere on Earth.

It has six classes (tundra, taiga, alpine, maritime, prairie, and ephemeral, each class defined by a unique ensemble of textural and stratigraphic characteristics including the sequence of snow layers, their thickness, density, and the crystal morphology and grain characteristics within each layer. The classes can also be derived using a binary system of three climate variables: wind, precipitation, and air temperature. Using this classification system, the Northern Hemisphere distribution of the snow cover classes is mapped on a 0.5° lat × 0.5° long grid. These maps are compared to maps prepared from snow cover data collected in the former Soviet Union and Alaska. For these areas where both climatologically based and texturally based snow cover maps are available, there is 62\% and 90\% agreement, respectively. Five of the six snow classes are found in Alaska. From 1989 through 1992, hourly measurements, consisting of 40 thermal and physical parameters, including snow depth, the temperature distribution in the snow, and basal heat flow, were made on four of these classes. In addition, snow stratigraphy and texture were measured every six weeks. Factor analysis indicates that the snow classes can be readily discriminated using four or more winter average thermal or physical parameters. Further, analysis of hourly time series indicates that 84\% of the time, spot measurements of the parameters are sufficient to correctly differentiate the snow cover class. Using the new snow classification system, 1) classes can readily be distinguished using observations of simple thermal parameters, 2) physical and thermal attributes of the snow can be inferred, and 3) classes can be mapped from climate data for use in regional and global climate modeling.}},

abstract = {{Porous materials are common on the Earth's surface and in the crust. Accordingly, their physical properties have received a lot of attention. A century ago, Maxwell and Rayleigh each modeled the physical properties of aggregate materials as discrete spheres embedded in continuous matrices. Although the particles of interest in snow are not spheres and do have interconnections, these basic models give first‐order predictions of the thermal conductivity. In the last 3 decades, scientists have attempted to make the predictions more precise by determining the effect of geometry on heat and mass flow using basic physical models and data collected from images of planar sections of aggregates. Under favorable circumstances, physical parameters and quantitative microscopic parameters of an aggregate may be highly correlated, but physical understandings of the geometric effects are not likely to arise from such studies until physical models can be based on measurable fundamental parameters. In snow, as in other aggregates, that goal seems to be a long way from realization.}},

abstract = {{Airborne photogrammetry is undergoing a renaissance: lower-cost equipment, more powerful software, and simplified methods have significantly lowered the barriers to entry and now allow repeat mapping of cryospheric dynamics at spatial resolutions and temporal frequencies that were previously too expensive to consider. Here we apply these advancements to the measurement of snow depth from manned aircraft. Our main airborne hardware consists of a consumer-grade digital camera directly coupled to a dual-frequency GPS; no inertial motion unit (IMU) or on-board computer is required, such that system hardware and software costs less than USD 30 000, exclusive of aircraft. The photogrammetric processing is done using a commercially available implementation of the structure from motion (SfM) algorithm. The system is simple enough that it can be operated by the pilot without additional assistance and the technique creates directly georeferenced maps without ground control, further reducing overall costs. To map snow depth, we made digital elevation models (DEMs) during snow-free and snow-covered conditions, then subtracted these to create difference DEMs (dDEMs). We assessed the accuracy (real-world geolocation) and precision (repeatability) of our DEMs through comparisons to ground control points and to time series of our own DEMs. We validated these assessments through comparisons to DEMs made by airborne lidar and by a similar photogrammetric system. We empirically determined that our DEMs have a geolocation accuracy of ±30 cm and a repeatability of ±8 cm (both 95 \% confidence). We then validated our dDEMs against more than 6000 hand-probed snow depth measurements at 3 separate test areas in Alaska covering a wide-variety of terrain and snow types. These areas ranged from 5 to 40 km2 and had ground sample distances of 6 to 20 cm. We found that depths produced from the dDEMs matched probe depths with a 10 cm standard deviation, and were statistically identical at 95 \% confidence. Due to the precision of this technique, other real changes on the ground such as frost heave, vegetative compaction by snow, and even footprints become sources of error in the measurement of thin snow packs (}},

The flow decreases as ice-layer thickness increases and, in general, flow changes with permeability. However, the magnitude of the effect is proportionately weaker when the ice layers are further from the surface.

abstract = {{In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed "DeepLab" system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7\% mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes.

abstract = {{The thermal conductivity of snow determines the temperature gradient, and by this, it has a direct effect on the rate of snow metamorphism. It is therefore a key property of snow. However, thermal conductivities measured with the transient needle probe and the steady-state, heat flux plate differ. In addition, the anisotropy of thermal conductivity plays an important role in the accuracy of thermal conductivity measurements. In this study, we investigated three independent methods to measure snow thermal conductivity and its anisotropy: a needle probe with a long heating time, a guarded heat flux plate, and direct numerical simulation at the microstructural level of the pore and ice structure. The three methods were applied to identical snow samples. We analyzed the consistency and the difference between these methods. As already shown in former studies, we observed a distinct difference between the anisotropy of thermal conductivity in small rounded grains and in depth hoar. Indeed, the anisotropy between vertical and horizontal thermal conductivity components ranges between 0.5–2. This can cause a difference in thermal conductivity measurements carried out with needle probes of up to –25 \% to +25 \% if the thermal conductivity is calculated only from a horizontally inserted needle probe. Based on our measurements and the comparison of the three methods studied here, the direct numerical simulation is the most reliable method, as the tensorial components of the thermal conductivity can be calculated and the corresponding microstructure is precisely known.}},

doi = {10.1002/2017wr020618}, 
abstract = {{Two common refrains about using the one‐dimensional advection diffusion equation to estimate fluid fluxes and thermal conductivity from temperature time series in streambeds are that the solution assumes that (1) the surface boundary condition is a sine wave or nearly so, and (2) there is no gradient in mean temperature with depth. Although the mathematical posing of the problem in the original solution to the problem might lead one to believe these constraints exist, the perception that they are a source of error is a fallacy. Here we develop a mathematical proof demonstrating the equivalence of the solution as developed based on an arbitrary (Fourier integral) surface temperature forcing when evaluated at a single given frequency versus that derived considering a single frequency from the beginning. The implication is that any single frequency can be used in the frequency‐domain solutions to estimate thermal diffusivity and 1‐D fluid flux in streambeds, even if the forcing has multiple frequencies. This means that diurnal variations with asymmetric shapes or gradients in the mean temperature with depth are not actually assumptions, and deviations from them should not cause errors in estimates. Given this clarification, we further explore the potential for using information at multiple frequencies to augment the information derived from time series of temperature. Measuring temperature over time at different depths in streambeds has become a common practice for estimating infiltration into streambeds or upwelling water rates. These values are important for fish eggs, stream‐bottom insects, filtering of pollutants in streams, and managing water resources. It has often been assumed that real‐life temperature fluctuations, which are a bit noisy and only look approximately like sine waves, caused errors in these calculations. It was also thought that a warm stream flowing above cold groundwater (another common situation) could cause errors. The mathematical derivations in this paper and accompanying laboratory work show that neither of these assumed sources of error actually cause errors. This is good news, as it crosses two suspects off the list when we try to trace errors, and we can turn our attention toward more serious issues when thinking about how to improve these calculations. “Perfect” sine waves and zero gradient in mean temperature are not assumptions of temperature‐tracer methods to estimate streambed fluxes The amplitude‐phase solution can be used with one or multiple frequencies when using the Fourier transform Only a single frequency is needed to solve for and but use of other frequencies is possible as well}},

We find that both theoretical predictions underestimate high-frequency perturbation pressure attenuation with depth in the near-surface snowpack and the discrepancy between theory and measurement increases with perturbation pressure frequency. The impact of this result for near-surface snow is that potential enhanced sublimation will occur over a shallower snow depth than these two theories predict. Correspondingly, interstitial air mixing at depth in firn will be driven by lower frequencies than these two theories predict. While direct measurement of these energy-rich lower frequencies is beyond the scope of this paper, stationary pressure measurements validate the presence of a pressure field that could drive near-surface circulation.}},

abstract = {{All currently available climate models predict a near-surface warming trend under the influence of rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In addition to the direct effects on climate—for example, on the frequency of heatwaves—this increase in surface temperatures has important consequences for the hydrological cycle, particularly in regions where water supply is currently dominated by melting snow or ice. In a warmer world, less winter precipitation falls as snow and the melting of winter snow occurs earlier in spring. Even without any changes in precipitation intensity, both of these effects lead to a shift in peak river runoff to winter and early spring, away from summer and autumn when demand is highest. Where storage capacities are not sufficient, much of the winter runoff will immediately be lost to the oceans. With more than one-sixth of the Earth's population relying on glaciers and seasonal snow packs for their water supply, the consequences of these hydrological changes for future water availability—predicted with high confidence and already diagnosed in some regions—are likely to be severe. Health warningNature this week includes reviews, original research and comment on a hot topic, the regional effects of climate change. The cover image — Chicago during the July 1995 heatwave — highlights one potential risk. Patz et al. consider the available evidence and suggest that climate warming already contributes to ill health and thousands of premature deaths across the world, and is likely to have serious health implications in the future. Recent work suggests that some regions are particularly at risk: areas where climate is dominated by El Niño/Southern Oscillation events, sub-Saharan Africa, and sprawling urban areas subject to the heat island effect are already suffering from climate impacts and these are projected to increase. In many cases, regions at high risk are those least responsible for causing climate change. Sure thing All currently available climate models predict a near-surface warming trend under the influence of rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Barnett et al. evaluate the effect of such a warming trend on regional hydrology, particularly in snowmelt-dominated environments. They suggest that warming will cause a change from snowfall to rain, diminishing natural water storage capacity, as well as earlier melting of winter snow, shifting peak river runoff away from the periods of highest demand in summer and autumn. The reduction in glaciers and snow-packs are likely to have severe consequences for the water supply of one-sixth of the Earth's population. Water supply It is generally assumed that climate change will alter the hydrological cycle, but predicting which parts of the world will be drier and which will be wetter is a difficult problem. Milly et al. focus on streamflow and water availability trends and find that an ensemble of twelve current climate models accurately accounts for twentieth-century changes. The same models project potentially crucial regional effects on streamflow in the future that could threaten the availability of freshwater in many regions of the world by the year 2050.}},

Measuring SWE takes ∼20 times as long as measuring depth, which in part is why depth measurements outnumber SWE measurements worldwide. Here a method of estimating snow bulk density is presented and then used to convert snow depth to SWE. The method is grounded in the fact that depth varies over a range that is many times greater than that of bulk density. Consequently, estimates derived from measured depths and modeled densities generally fall close to measured values of SWE. Knowledge of snow climate classes is used to improve the accuracy of the estimation procedure. A statistical model based on a Bayesian analysis of a set of 25 688 depth–density–SWE data collected in the United States, Canada, and Switzerland takes snow depth, day of the year, and the climate class of snow at a selected location from which it produces a local bulk density estimate. When converted to SWE and tested against two continental-scale datasets, 90\% of the computed SWE values fell within ±8 cm of the measured values, with most estimates falling much closer.}},

abstract = {{The quantity of liquid water in the snowpack defines its wetness. The temporal evolution of snow wetness’s plays a significant role in wet-snow avalanche prediction, meltwater release, and water availability estimations and assessments within a river basin. However, it remains a difficult task and a demanding issue to measure the snowpack’s liquid water content (LWC) and its temporal evolution with conventional in situ techniques. We propose an approach based on the use of time-domain reflectometry (TDR) and CS650 soil water content reflectometers to measure the snowpack’s LWC and temperature profiles. For this purpose, we created an easily-applicable, low-cost, automated, and continuous LWC profiling instrument using reflectometers at the Cooperative Remote Sensing Science and Technology Center-Snow Analysis and Field Experiment (CREST-SAFE) in Caribou, ME, USA, and tested it during the snow melt period (February–April) immediately after installation in 2014. Snow Thermal Model (SNTHERM) LWC simulations forced with CREST-SAFE meteorological data were used to evaluate the accuracy of the instrument. Results showed overall good agreement, but clearly indicated inaccuracy under wet snow conditions. For this reason, we present two (for dry and wet snow) statistical relationships between snow LWC and dielectric permittivity similar to Topp’s equation for the LWC of mineral soils. These equations were validated using CREST-SAFE in situ data from winter 2015. Results displayed high agreement when compared to LWC estimates obtained using empirical formulas developed in previous studies, and minor improvement over wet snow LWC estimates. Additionally, the equations seemed to be able to capture the snowpack state (i.e., onset of melt, medium, and maximum saturation). Lastly, field test results show advantages, such as: automated, continuous measurements, the temperature profiling of the snowpack, and the possible categorization of its state. However, future work should focus on improving the instrument’s capability to measure the snowpack’s LWC profile by properly calibrating it with in situ LWC measurements. Acceptable validation agreement indicates that the developed snow LWC, temperature, and wetness profiler offers a promising new tool for snow hydrology research.}},

Instead, Biot’s model of wave propagation in porous materials should be used. However, the application of Biot’s model is complicated by the large property space of the underlying porous material. Here constant properties for ice and air, and empirical relationships are used to estimate unknown porous properties from snow porosity. Using this set of equations, phase velocities and plane wave attenuation of shear- and compressional waves are predicted as functions of porosity or density. For light snow the peculiarity was found that the velocity of the first compressional wave is lower than that of the second compressional wave that is commonly referred to as the ‘slow’ wave. The reversal of the velocities comes with an increase of attenuation for the first compressional wave. This is in line with the common observation that sound is strongly absorbed in light snow. The results have important implications for the use of acoustic waves to evaluate snow properties and to numerically simulate wave propagation in snow.}},

More than a billion people rely on water from snow, most of which originates in the Northern Hemisphere mountain ranges. Yet, remote sensing observations of mountain snow depth are still lacking at the large scale. Here, we show the ability of Sentinel-1 to map snow depth in the Northern Hemisphere mountains at 1 km² resolution using an empirical change detection approach. An evaluation with measurements from \textbackslashtextasciitilde4000 sites and reanalysis data demonstrates that the Sentinel-1 retrievals capture the spatial variability between and within mountain ranges, as well as their inter-annual differences. This is showcased with the contrasting snow depths between 2017 and 2018 in the US Sierra Nevada and European Alps. With Sentinel-1 continuity ensured until 2030 and likely beyond, these findings lay a foundation for quantifying the long-term vulnerability of mountain snow-water resources to climate change. Remote sensing observations of mountain snow depth are still lacking for the Northern Hemisphere mountains. Here authors use Sentinel-1 satellite radar measurements to assess the snow depth in mountainous areas at 1 km² resolution and show that the Sentinel-1 retrievals capture the spatial variability between and within mountain ranges, as well as their inter-annual differences.}},

With snow cover changing worldwide in several worrisome ways, there is pressing need to determine global, regional, and local rates of snow cover change, and to link these to financial analyses that allow for rational decision making, as risks related to those decisions involve trillions of dollars. Snow is critical in sustaining human life. It provides water and plays a key role in the climate through its unrivaled power to cool the Earth. It is also changing rapidly. To date, a full financial evaluation of the importance of snow in our lives has not been made, but computations here and elsewhere indicate it is on the order of trillions of dollars. Against this value, the current costs of scientific research are trivial. We provide a strong rationale and guidelines for accelerated snow research that will allow society to make major impending decisions related to snow resources on the soundest base and best scientific knowledge.

A three‐element infrasound array 10 km from the summit, and 4 km from the lahar's closest approach, was used to study the flow's progression. Array processing using cross‐correlation lag times and semblance places constraints on the lahar's dynamics, including detection of an initial flow pulse that traveled from 2 to 12 km at an average speed of 38 m/s. Subsequently, the lahar signal evolved to a relatively stationary infrasonic tremor located 10 to 12 km from the vent and adjacent to a topographic notch, through which sound may have preferentially diffracted toward the recording site. This study demonstrates the powerful capabilities of infrasound arrays for lahar study and suggests their potential application for future hazard monitoring. Lahar is monitored for the first time using infrasound array Advancement of lahar was 38 m/s over 10 km section; detected flow lasted more than 2 h Use of infrasound surveillance has potential for future lahar study and hazard mitigation}},

In recent years, technological and signal processing advances have led to the development of operational infrasound avalanche detection systems. We evaluated the detection performance of four operationally running infrasound detection systems installed at three different sites in the Swiss Alps during two entire winter seasons. To this end, we collected a comprehensive data set of avalanche activity using a network of automatic cameras and supplementary field observations by local observers. The events automatically identified by the systems were then compared to the data set of visually observed avalanches. Only 3\% of the 839 observed avalanches were associated with automatic detections and 21\% of the automatic detections were confirmed by field observations. However, the majority of observed avalanches were small and most automatic detections occurred during periods of poor visibility. Furthermore, the probability of detection (POD) increased with avalanche size, decreased with distance, and varied with avalanche type. Dry-snow avalanches were generally better detected than wet-snow and mixed-type avalanches. Large avalanches (on the order of 300 m wide and 1000 m long) within a distance of 3 km from the array were typically well detected (POD ≈ 90\%). The false alarm ratio was estimated to 13–30\%.}},

Therefore, it is desirable to additionally learn corrections from a limited number of example repairs. To effectively generalize example repairs, it is necessary to capture the entire context of each erroneous value. A context comprises the value itself, the co-occurring values inside the same tuple, and all values that define the attribute type. Typically, an error corrector based on any of these context information undergoes an individual process of operations that is not always easy to integrate with other types of error correctors. In this paper, we present a new error correction system, Baran, which provides a unifying abstraction for integrating multiple error corrector models that can be pretrained and updated in the same way. Because of the holistic nature of our approach, we generate more correction candidates than state of the art and, because of the underlying context-aware data representation, we achieve high precision. We show that, by pretraining our models based on Wikipedia revisions, our system can further improve its overall precision and recall. In our experiments, Baran significantly outperforms state-of-the-art error correction systems in terms of effectiveness and human involvement requiring only 20 labeled tuples.}},

abstract = {{Pacific walruses (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) are using coastal haulouts in the Chukchi Sea more often and in larger numbers to rest between foraging bouts in late summer and autumn in recent years, because climate warming has reduced availability of sea ice that historically had provided resting platforms near their preferred benthic feeding grounds. With greater numbers of walruses hauling out in large aggregations, new opportunities are presented for monitoring the population. Here we evaluate different types of satellite imagery for detecting and delineating the peripheries of walrus aggregations at a commonly used haulout near Point Lay, Alaska, in 2018–2020. We evaluated optical and radar imagery ranging in pixel resolutions from 40 m to \textbackslashtextasciitilde1 m: specifically, optical imagery from Landsat, Sentinel-2, Planet Labs, and DigitalGlobe, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X. Three observers independently examined satellite images to detect walrus aggregations and digitized their peripheries using visual interpretation. We compared interpretations between observers and to high-resolution (\textbackslashtextasciitilde2 cm) ortho-corrected imagery collected by a small unoccupied aerial system (UAS). Roughly two-thirds of the time, clouds precluded clear optical views of the study area from satellite. SAR was unaffected by clouds (and darkness) and provided unambiguous signatures of walrus aggregations at the Point Lay haulout. Among imagery types with 4–10 m resolution, observers unanimously agreed on all detections of walruses, and attained an average 65\% overlap (sd 12.0, n 100) in their delineations of aggregation boundaries. For imagery with \textbackslashtextasciitilde1 m resolution, overlap agreement was higher (mean 85\%, sd 3.0, n 11). We found that optical satellite sensors with moderate resolution and high revisitation rates, such as PlanetScope and Sentinel-2, demonstrated robust and repeatable qualities for monitoring walrus haulouts, but temporal gaps between observations due to clouds were common. SAR imagery also demonstrated robust capabilities for monitoring the Point Lay haulout, but more research is needed to evaluate SAR at haulouts with more complex local terrain and beach substrates.}},

abstract = {{Area-based measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) are important for understanding earth system processes such as glacier mass balance, winter hydrological storage in drainage basins and ground thermal regimes. Remote sensing techniques are ideally suited for wide-scale area-based mapping with the most commonly used technique to measure SWE being passive-microwave, which is limited to coarse spatial resolutions of 25 km or greater, and to areas without significant topographic variation. Passive-microwave also has a negative bias for large SWE. Repeat-pass synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) as an alternate technique allows measurement of SWE change at much higher spatial resolution. However, it has not been widely adopted because: (1) the phase unwrapping problem has not been robustly addressed, especially for interferograms with poor coherence and; (2) SWE change maps scaled directly from repeat-pass interferograms are not an absolute measurement but contain unknown offsets for each contiguous coherent area. We develop and test a novel method for repeat-pass InSAR based dry-snow SWE estimation that exploits the sensitivity of the dry-snow refraction-induced InSAR phase to topographic variations. The method robustly estimates absolute SWE change at spatial resolutions of < 1 km, without the need for phase unwrapping. We derive a quantitative signal model for this new SWE change estimator and identify the relevant sources of bias. The method is demonstrated using both simulated SWE distributions and a 9-year RADARSAT-2 spotlight-mode dataset near Inuvik, NWT, Canada. SWE results are compared to in situ snow survey measurements and estimates from ERA5 reanalysis. Our method performs well in high-relief areas and in areas with high SWE (> 150 mm), thus providing complementary coverage to other passive- and active-microwave based SWE estimation methods. Further, our method has the advantage of requiring only a single wavelength band and thus can utilize existing spaceborne synthetic aperture radar systems. In application, a first order analysis of SWE trends within three drainage basins suggests that differences between basin-level accumulations are a function of major landcover types, and that re-vegetation following a forest-tundra fire that occurred over 50 years ago continues to affect the spatial distribution of SWE accumulation in the study area.}},

There is a need to improve monitoring capabilities in order to reliably detect and locate avalanche activity, which will help to validate avalanche hazard assessments. Recent work has demonstrated the utility of infrasound as it can provide continuous monitoring and broad geographic coverage. Here, we present the first use of infrasound to monitor snow avalanche activity in a maritime climate along the Milford Road in Fiordland, New Zealand (Aotearoa). Size 4 (or larger) plunging avalanches frequently occur along the Milford Road, which travels through a glacial-carved valley with steep cliffs (slope angles can exceed 50∘) that are over 1000 m tall. We deployed two infrasound arrays on the eastern side of the Homer Tunnel and recorded triggered and natural avalanches during our month-long field campaign. We use array processing to identify avalanche signals, calculate back-azimuths, and triangulate source locations. Source locations are well constrained for avalanches that are in-network but are worse for avalanches that occur out-of-network, likely due to topographic scattering of acoustic waves from the steep valley walls. The infrasound amplitudes are substantially larger than previously recorded at other locations with a maximum peak-to-peak amplitude of 37 Pa detected for a large triggered avalanche, which reflects the unique dynamics of the avalanches along the Milford Road. This study demonstrates the utility of infrasound for snow avalanche monitoring in maritime climates and showcases an efficient processing workflow that could be easily operationalized.}},

We first modified the Chang algorithm and then validated it using meteorological observation data, considering the influences from vegetation, wet snow, precipitation, cold desert and frozen ground. Furthermore, the modified algorithm is dynamically adjusted based on the seasonal variation of grain size and snow density. Snow-depth distribution is indirectly validated by MODIS snow-cover products by comparing the snow-extent area from this work. The final snow-depth datasets from 1978 to 2006 show that the interannual snow-depth variation is very significant. The spatial and temporal distribution of snow depth is illustrated and discussed, including the steady snow-cover regions in China and snow-mass trend in these regions. Though the areal extent of seasonal snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere indicates a weak decrease over a long period, there is no clear trend in change of snow-cover area extent in China. However, snow mass over the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau and northwestern China has increased, while it has weakly decreased in northeastern China. Overall, snow depth in China during the past three decades shows significant interannual variation, with a weak increasing trend.}},

abstract = {{Since their development in the 1960s, seismic arrays have given a new impulse to seismology. Recordings from many uniform seismometers in a well-defined, closely spaced configuration produce high-quality and homogeneous data sets, which can be used to study the Earth's structure in great detail. Apart from an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio due to the simple summation of the individual array recordings, seismological arrays can be used in many different ways to study the fine-scale structure of the Earth's interior. They have helped to study such different structures as the interior of volcanos, continental crust and lithosphere, global variations of seismic velocities in the mantle, the core-mantle boundary and the structure of the inner core. For this purpose many different, specialized array techniques have been developed and applied to an increasing number of high-quality array data sets. Most array methods use the ability of seismic arrays to measure the vector velocity of an incident wave front, i.e., slowness and back azimuth. This information can be used to distinguish between different seismic phases, separate waves from different seismic events and improve the signal-to-noise ratio by stacking with respect to the varying slowness of different phases. The vector velocity information of scattered or reflected phases can be used to determine the region of the Earth from whence the seismic energy comes and with what structures it interacted. Therefore seismic arrays are perfectly suited to study the small-scale structure and variations of the material properties of the Earth. In this review we will give an introduction to various array techniques which have been developed since the 1960s. For each of these array techniques we give the basic mathematical equations and show examples of applications. The advantages and disadvantages and the appropriate applications and restrictions of the techniques will also be discussed. The main methods discussed are the beam-forming method, which forms the basis for several other methods, different slant stacking techniques, and frequency–wave number analysis. Finally, some methods used in exploration geophysics that have been adopted for global seismology are introduced. This is followed by a description of temporary and permanent arrays installed in the past, as well as existing arrays and seismic networks. We highlight their purposes and discuss briefly the advantages and disadvantages of different array configurations.}},

abstract = {{Extensive efforts have been made to observe the accumulation and melting of seasonal snow. However, making accurate observations of snow water equivalent (SWE) at global scales is challenging. Active radar systems show promise, provided the dielectric properties of the snowpack are accurately constrained. The dielectric constant (k) determines the velocity of a radar wave through snow, which is a critical component of time-of-flight radar techniques such as ground penetrating radar and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). However, equations used to estimate k have been validated only for specific conditions with limited in situ validation for seasonal snow applications. The goal of this work was to further understand the dielectric permittivity of seasonal snow under both dry and wet conditions. We utilized extensive direct field observations of k, along with corresponding snow density and liquid water content (LWC) measurements. Data were collected in the Jemez Mountains, NM; Sandia Mountains, NM; Grand Mesa, CO; and Cameron Pass, CO from February 2020 to May 2021. We present empirical relationships based on 146 snow pits for dry snow conditions and 92 independent LWC observations in naturally melting snowpacks. Regression results had r2 values of 0.57 and 0.37 for dry and wet snow conditions, respectively. Our results in dry snow showed large differences between our in situ observations and commonly applied equations. We attribute these differences to assumptions in the shape of the snow grains that may not hold true for seasonal snow applications. Different assumptions, and thus different equations, may be necessary for varying snowpack conditions in different climates, suggesting that further testing is necessary. When considering wet snow, large differences were found between commonly applied equations and our in situ measurements. Many previous equations assume a background (dry snow) k that we found to be inaccurate, as previously stated, and is the primary driver of resulting uncertainty. Our results suggest large errors in SWE (10–15\%) or LWC (0.05–0.07 volumetric LWC) estimates based on current equations. The work presented here could prove useful for making accurate observations of changes in SWE using future InSAR opportunities such as NISAR and ROSE-L.}},

Measurement includes ground-based campaign (SnowScat) and airborne mission (SnowSAR). Both the quasi-crystalline approximation (QCA) model and the bicontinuous model are used for a multilayer snow medium. Two size parameters are used for both models. Grain size and stickiness parameter are used for QCA model. The bicontinuous model has two parameters: the mean wave number \$\textbackslashlangle \textbackslashbm\{\textbackslashzeta \}\textbackslashrangle\$ and the parameter \$\{\textbackslashbm\{b\}\}\$. The mean wave number \$\textbackslashlangle \textbackslashbm\{\textbackslashzeta\}\textbackslashrangle \$ corresponds to the inverse of the grain size, while the \$\{\textbackslashbm\{b\}\}\$ parameter controls the width of the wave number distribution and is related to the clustering property. The bicontinuous model is used to generate the microstructures of snow by computer, and Maxwell equations are solved numerically for each sample of computer-generated structure to calculate the extinction coefficient and the phase matrix. Other geometric descriptors of the bicontinuous medium include correlation functions and specific surface areas, both of which can be calculated from the parameters \$\textbackslashlangle \textbackslashbm\{\textbackslashzeta \}\textbackslashrangle \$ and \$\{\textbackslashbm\{b\}\}\$. In making comparisons, we use ground measurements of specific surface area, grain size, densities, and layering of snow cover as input for the theoretical models. The geometric properties and the scattering properties of the bicontinuous model are also compared with past models. In making the multifrequency comparisons, we use the same physical parameters of all three frequencies: 1)X band; 2)Ku bands of 13.3GHz; and 3)16.7GHz. It is emphasized that the DMRT models provide frequency, size, and angular dependence that depart from the classical model of Rayleigh scattering and are in better agreement with experimental observations.}},

Interactions between these different processes create spatially variable patterns of snow depth across a landscape. Variations in accumulation and redistribution occur at a variety of spatial scales, which are well established for moderate mountain terrain. However, spatial patterns of snow depth variability in steep, complex mountain terrain have not been fully explored due to insufficient spatial resolutions of snow depth measurement. Recent advances in uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) and structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry provide an opportunity to map spatially continuous snow depths at high resolutions in these environments. Using UASs and SfM photogrammetry, we produced 11 snow depth maps at a steep couloir site in the Bridger Range of Montana, USA, during the 2019–2020 winter. We quantified the spatial scales of snow depth variability in this complex mountain terrain at a variety of resolutions over 2 orders of magnitude (0.02 to 20 m) and time steps (4 to 58 d) using variogram analysis in a high-performance computing environment. We found that spatial resolutions greater than 0.5 m do not capture the complete patterns of snow depth spatial variability within complex mountain terrain and that snow depths are autocorrelated within horizontal distances of 15 m at our study site. The results of this research have the potential to reduce uncertainty currently associated with snowpack and snow water resource analysis by documenting and quantifying snow depth variability and snowpack evolution on relatively inaccessible slopes in complex terrain at high spatial and temporal resolutions.}},

The sample coherence magnitude is calculated over a moving window to generate a coherence magnitude map. High-resolution coherence maps may be useful to discriminate fine structures. Coarser resolution is needed for a more accurate estimation of the coherence magnitude. In this study, the accuracy of coherence estimation is investigated as a function of the coherence map resolution. It is shown that the space-averaged coherence magnitude is biased toward higher values. The accuracy of the coherence magnitude estimate obtained is a function of the number of pixels averaged and the number of independent samples per pixel (i.e., the coherence map resolution). A method is proposed to remove the bias from the space-averaged sample coherence magnitude. Coherence magnitude estimation from complex (magnitude and phase) coherence maps is also considered. It is established that the magnitude of the averaged sample coherence estimate is slightly biased for high-resolution coherence maps and that the bias reduces with coarser resolution. Finally, coherence estimation for nonstationary targets is discussed. It is shown that the averaged sample coherence obtained from complex coherence maps or coherence magnitude maps is suitable for estimation of nonstationary coherence. The averaged sample (complex) coherence permits the calculation of an unbiased coherence estimate, provided that the original signals can be assumed to be locally stationary over a sufficiently coarse resolution cell.}},

At present, quantification of frontal position change primarily relies on time-consuming and subjective manual mapping techniques, limiting our ability to understand changes to glacier calving fronts. Here we describe a newly developed automated method of mapping glacier calving fronts in satellite imagery using observations from a representative sample of Greenland’s peripheral marine-terminating glaciers. Our method is adapted from the 2-D wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) segmentation method, which has been used previously for image segmentation in biomedical and other applied science fields. The gradient-based method places edge detection lines along regions with the greatest intensity gradient in the image, such as the contrast between glacier ice and water or glacier ice and sea ice. The lines corresponding to the calving front are identified using thresholds for length, average gradient value, and orientation that minimize the misfit with respect to a manual validation data set. We demonstrate that the method is capable of mapping glacier calving fronts over a wide range of image conditions (light to intermediate cloud cover, dim or bright, mélange presence, etc.). With these time series, we are able to resolve subseasonal to multiyear temporal patterns as well as regional patterns in glacier frontal position change.}},

An extensive reanalysis of results from previous field studies in different snow environments around the world is presented, followed by an analysis of field data on spatial variability of snow collected in the headwaters of the Jollie River basin, a rugged mountain catchment in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. In addition, area‐averaged simulations of SWE based on different types of spatial discretization are evaluated. Spatial variability of SWE is shaped by a range of different processes that occur across a hierarchy of spatial scales. Spatial variability at the watershed‐scale is shaped by variability in near‐surface meteorological fields (e.g., elevation gradients in temperature) and, provided suitable meteorological data is available, can be explicitly resolved by spatial interpolation/extrapolation. On the other hand, spatial variability of SWE at the hillslope‐scale is governed by processes such as drifting, sloughing of snow off steep slopes, trapping of snow by shrubs, and the nonuniform unloading of snow by the forest canopy, which are more difficult to resolve explicitly. Subgrid probability distributions are often capable of representing the aggregate‐impact of unresolved processes at the hillslope‐scale, though they may not adequately capture the effects of elevation gradients. While the best modeling strategy is case‐specific, the analysis in this paper provides guidance on both the suitability of several common snow modeling approaches and on the choice of parameter values in subgrid probability distributions. Spatial variability is shaped by a mix of processes across a hierarchy of scales Probability distributions effectively represent variability at unresolved scales Explicitly resolving all processes requires an extremely fine horizontal grid}},

To address the broad range of disciplines and scientific study areas of the mission, a dual-frequency system was conceived, at L-band (24 cm wavelength) and S-band (10 cm wavelength). To achieve these observational characteristics, a reflector-feed system is considered, whereby the feed aperture elements are individually sampled to allow a scan-on-receive (“SweepSAR”) capability at both L-band and S-band.

However, far too little attention has been paid to utilizing remote sensing mapping avalanches quickly and automatically to mitigate calamity. Such endeavors are limited by formidable natural conditions, human subjective judgement and insufficient understanding of avalanches, so they have been incomplete and inaccurate. This paper presents an objective and widely serviceable method for regional auto-detection using the scattering and interference characteristics of avalanches extracted from Sentinel-1 SLC images. Six indices are established to distinguish avalanches from surrounding undisturbed snow. The active avalanche belts in Kizilkeya and Aktep of the Western TianShan Mountains in China lend urgency to this research. Implementation found that smaller avalanches can be consistently identified more accurately in descending images. Specifically, 281 and 311 avalanches were detected in the ascending and descending of Kizilkeya, respectively. The corresponding numbers on Aktep are 104 and 114, respectively. The resolution area of single avalanche detection can reach 0.09 km2. The performance of the model was excellent in all cases (areas under the curve are 0.831 and 0.940 in descending and ascending of Kizilkeya, respectively; and 0.807 and 0.938 of Aktep, respectively). Overall, the evaluation of statistical indices are POD > 0.75, FAR < 0.34, FOM < 0.13 and TSS > 0.75. The results indicate that the performance of the innovation proposed in this paper, which employs multivariate comprehensive descriptions of avalanche characteristics to actualize regional automatic detection, can be more objective, accurate, applicable and robust to a certain extent. The latest and more complete avalanche inventory generated by this design can effectively assist in addressing the increasingly severe avalanche disasters and improving public awareness of avalanches in alpine areas.}},

Meteorological data from automatic weather stations were interpolated to 100 m horizontal resolution and precipitation was scaled with snow depth measurements from airborne laser scanning. Modeled snow instability metrics assessed for two different weak layers suggested that the weak layer closer to the snow surface was more variable. Initially, it was less stable than the weak layer closer to the ground, yet it stabilized faster as the winter progressed. In spring, the simulated snowpack on south-facing slopes stabilized faster than on north-facing slopes, in line with the regional avalanche forecast. In the winter months January to March 2017, simulated instability metrics did not suggest that the snowpack on south-facing slopes was more stable, as reported in the regional avalanche forecast.

Yet, traditional monitoring techniques, such as punctual measurements in the field, do not cover the full snowpack spatial and temporal variability, which hampers efforts to upscale measurements to the global scale. This variability is one of the primary constraints in model development. In terms of spatial resolution, active microwaves (synthetic aperture radar—SAR) can address the issue and outperform methods based on passive microwaves. Thus, high spatial resolution monitoring of snow depth (SD) would allow for better parameterization of local processes that drive the spatial variability of snow. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of the TerraSAR-X (TSX) SAR sensor and the wave co-polar phase difference (CPD) method for characterizing snow cover at high spatial resolution. Consequently, we first (1) quantified the spatio-temporal variability of the geophysical properties of the snowpack in an Arctic catchment, we then (2) studied the links between snow properties and CPD, considering ground vegetation. Snow depth (SD) could be extracted using the CPD when certain conditions are met. A high incidence angle (> 30°) with a high Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) (> 7.0) showed correlation between SD and CPD (R-squared up to 0.72). Further, future work should address a threshold of sensitivity to TWI and incidence angle to map snow depth in such environments and assess the potential of using interpolation tools to fill in gaps in SD information on drier vegetation types.}},

Results are negatively biased (median difference of −0.22 m) when compared against observations from a terrestrial Light Detection And Ranging scan, though replicate general snow depth variability well. Additionally, the Pléiades dataset is subject to data gaps (17\% of total pixels), negative values for shallow snow (12\%), and noise on slopes >40–50° (2\%). We correct and filter the Pléiades snow depths using surface classification techniques of snow‐free areas and a random forest model for data gap filling. Snow depths (with an estimated error of \textbackslashtextasciitilde0.36 m) average 1.66 m and relate well to topographical parameters such as elevation and northness in a similar way to previous studies. However, estimations of snow depth based upon topography (TOPO) or physically based modeling (DBSM) cannot resolve localized processes (i.e., avalanching or wind scouring) that are detected by Pléiades, even when forced with locally calibrated data. Comparing these alternative model approaches to corrected Pléiades snow depths reveals total snow volume differences between −28\% (DBSM) and +54\% (TOPO) for the catchment and large differences across most elevation bands.

The SCA product was the fraction of each 1 km2 pixel covered by snow and was derived from NOAA advanced very high‐resolution radiometer imagery. The SWE product was developed by multiplying the SCA product by SWE estimates interpolated from National Resources Conservation Service snow telemetry point measurements for a 6 year period (1995‐2000). Measured SCA and SWE estimates were consistently lower than values estimated from temperature and precipitation within PRMS. The greatest differences occurred in the relatively complex terrain of the Rio Grande basin, as opposed to the relatively homogeneous terrain of the Black River basin, where differences were small. Differences between modelled and measured snow were different for the accumulation period versus the ablation period and had an elevational trend. Assimilating the measured snowfields into a version of PRMS calibrated to achieve water balance without assimilation led to reduced performance in estimating streamflow for the Rio Grande and increased performance in estimating streamflow for the Black River basin. Correcting the measured SCA and SWE for canopy effects improved simulations by adding snow mostly in the mid‐to‐high elevations, where satellite estimates of SCA are lower than model estimates.

abstract = {{Despite widespread warming in mountain regions, little research to date has explored the physical mechanisms driving the variable response of snowpacks to changes in climate, instead focusing primarily on empirical relationships, such as seasonal air temperature or elevation. In this work, we evaluate how differences in snowfall fraction, cold content, and the snowpack energy balance produce simulated changes to snow accumulation and melt at an alpine and subalpine snowpack in the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research site. For our analysis, we created a 23 years baseline simulation using the SNOWPACK model forced by historical hourly meteorological data from water year 1991 through 2013. We then perturbed hourly air temperature in 0.5°C increments from +0.5 to +4.0°C above baseline and increased incoming longwave radiation accordingly. For every 1°C of warming, peak snow water equivalent declined by 43.9 mm in the alpine and 54.3 mm in the subalpine, melt onset shifted 6.2 days earlier in the alpine and 8.8 days in the subalpine, the snow season shortened by 10.7 days in the alpine and 16.4 days in the subalpine, and melt rate increased by 0.2 mm d−1 in the alpine while decreasing by 0.4 mm d−1 in the subalpine. We found the alpine snowpack was less sensitive to warming for three primary reasons: (1) Snowfall fraction decreased less rapidly per 1°C of warming than in the subalpine; (2) Cold content still consistently developed throughout the snow season, preventing mid-winter melt events; (3) Changes to snowmelt rate were not significant because increases to the turbulent fluxes balanced decreases in the radiative fluxes with earlier snowmelt onset. Additionally, at 3°C of warming and greater, the subalpine site experienced a fundamental shift where significant melt could occur throughout the entirety of the winter as cold content was no longer large enough to buffer against positive energy fluxes. In some years, the subalpine snowpack became transient with several cycles of accumulation and melt per winter. This tipping point suggests sites with lower cold content—like the subalpine studied here—are likely to be more sensitive to producing increased winter melt as warming continues over the coming decades.}},

abstract = {{During operational ash-cloud forecasting, prediction of ash concentration and total erupted mass directly depends on the determination of mass eruption rate (MER), which is typically inferred from plume height. Uncertainties for plume heights are large, especially for bent-over plumes in which the ascent dynamics are strongly affected by the surrounding wind field. Here we show how uncertainties can be reduced if MER is derived directly from geophysical observations of source dynamics. The combination of infrasound measurements and thermal camera imagery allows for the infrasonic type of source to be constrained (a dipole in this case) and for the plume exit velocity to be calculated (54–142m/s) based on the acoustic signal recorded during the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption from 4 to 21 May. Exit velocities are converted into MER using additional information on vent diameter (50±10m) and mixture density (5.4±1.1kg/m3), resulting in an average ∼9×105kg/s MER during the considered period of the eruption. We validate our acoustic-derived MER by using independent measurements of plume heights (Icelandic Meteorological Office radar observations). Acoustically derived MER are converted into plume heights using field-based relationships and a 1D radially averaged buoyant plume theory model using a reconstructed total grain size distribution. We conclude that the use of infrasonic monitoring may lead to important understanding of the plume dynamics and allows for real-time determination of eruption source parameters. This could improve substantially the forecasting of volcano-related hazards, with important implications for civil aviation safety.}},

We estimate the spatial distribution of SWE for the Upper Colorado River basin weekly from January to June 2001–2012 in quasireal‐time by two regression techniques: a baseline regression of in situ operationally measured point SWE using only physiographic information and regression of these in situ points combining both physiographic information and historical SWE patterns from a remote sensing‐based SWE reconstruction model. We compare the baseline regression approach to our new regression in the context of spatial snow surveys and operational snow measuring stations. When compared to independent distributed snow surveys, the new regression reduces the bias of SWE estimates from −5.5\% to 0.8\%, and RMSE of the SWE estimates by 8\% from 0.25 m to 0.23 m. Notable improvements were observed in alpine terrain with bias declining from −38\% to only 3.4\%, and RMSE was reduced by 13\%, from 0.47 to 0.41 m. The mean increase in cross‐validated r2 for the new regression compared to the baseline regression is from 0.22 to 0.33. The largest increase in r2 in any one year is 0.19, an 83\% improvement. The new regression estimates, on average, 31\% greater SWE depth than the baseline regression in areas above 3000 m elevation, which contributes up to 66\% of annual SWE volume in the driest year. This indicates that the historical SWE patterns from the reconstruction adds information to the interpolation beyond the physiographic conditions represented by the SNOTEL network. Given that previous works using SWE reconstructions were limited to retrospective analyses by necessity, the work presented here represents an important contribution in that it extends SWE reconstructions to real‐time applications and illustrates that doing so significantly improves the accuracy of SWE estimates. Real‐time SWE estimates are generated by merging remotely sensed and ground‐based snow data Past spatial patterns of snowpack improve real‐time regression‐based estimates of SWE Improvements are particularly notable in unsampled locations}},

Snowpack temperature gradients play a key role in snow metamorphism, and their magnitude controls how snow strength changes; therefore, they are of interest to avalanche forecasters. Before major melt, the snowpack must warm to isothermal conditions at 0°C. Measuring this transition from warming to the ripening phase could help improve our current models for runoﬀ timing. Measuring snowpack temperature gradients is currently a non-automated process that requires disturbance of the snow proﬁle, and only gives a snapshot in time of the temperature conditions. Here we demonstrate an automated method to monitor in situ snowpack temperature using a thermocouple array, co-located with the Banner Summit SNOTEL site in central Idaho. Showing the location and duration of critical temperature gradients helps avalanche forecasters detect warning signs related to possible facet formation. During the 2019 winter, we observed large temperature gradients in the bottom 20cm of the snowpack, with the gradient falling below critical (<0.1°C/cm) by early January. Critical gradients were observed near the surface throughout the winter, and temperatures were within ± 0.06 °C of the melting point when the snowpack became isothermal in the spring. We anticipate this dataset will inform snowpack energy balance models and aid in the prediction of avalanche hazards and runoﬀ timing.}}

abstract = {{The related challenges of predictions in ungauged basins and predictions in ungauged climates point to the need to develop environmental models that are transferable across both space and time. Hydrologic modeling has historically focused on modelling one or only a few basins using highly parameterized conceptual or physically based models. However, model parameters and structures have been shown to change significantly when calibrated to new basins or time periods, suggesting that model complexity and model transferability may be antithetical. Empirical space‐for‐time models provide a framework within which to assess model transferability and any tradeoff with model complexity. Using 497 SNOTEL sites in the western U.S., we develop space‐for‐time models of April 1 SWE and Snow Residence Time based on mean winter temperature and cumulative winter precipitation. The transferability of the models to new conditions (in both space and time) is assessed using non‐random cross‐validation tests with consideration of the influence of model complexity on transferability. As others have noted, the algorithmic empirical models transfer best when minimal extrapolation in input variables is required. Temporal split‐sample validations use pseudoreplicated samples, resulting in the selection of overly complex models, which has implications for the design of hydrologic model validation tests. Finally, we show that low to moderate complexity models transfer most successfully to new conditions in space and time, providing empirical confirmation of the parsimony principal. A challenge for environmental modeling and prediction is to create models that work everywhere. This includes places where we don't have data and it also includes the future. An additional challenge is choosing an appropriate model for these new conditions.To select a model, we built snow models of varying complexity and evaluated how well they predicted snowpack in new locations and time periods. The models performed well when applied to new time periods since certain environmental variables remained constant over time, including shading and solar radiation, resulting in the time samples being statistically dependent. For these applications, validation tended to select overly complex models. When applied to new locations, the models provided good predictions as long as the conditions in the new location were not drastically different from the conditions the model was trained on. Finally, we found that simple to moderate‐complexity models did better than complex models at predicting in new conditions. A top‐down conceptual representation of snow storage showed strong transferability across a range of challenging validation tests Low to moderate complexity models transfer most successfully to new conditions Validation‐based model selection favors overfit models when calibration and validation samples are pseudoreplicated}},

To investigate this partitioning, we use endmember splitting and mixing analyses based on stable isotope (18O) data from nine headwater catchments in the East River, Colorado. Our results show that one third of the snow partitions to ET and 13\% of the snowmelt sustains summer streamflow. Only 8\% of the rainfall contributes to the summer streamflow, because most of the rain (67\%) partitions to ET. The spatial variability of precipitation partitioning is mainly driven by aspect and tree cover across the sub‐catchments. Catchments with higher tree cover have a higher share of snow becoming ET, resulting in less snow in summer streamflow. Summer streamflow did not contain more rain with higher rainfall sums, but more rain was taken up in ET. Snowmelt from the Rocky Mountains is crucial for the water supply in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB). With reduced snowpack and earlier snowmelt due to climate change, it is important to understand how much of the snow directly contributes to streamflow and how much returns directly to the atmosphere via evaporation and vegetation use, called evapotranspiration (ET). We applied a stable isotope mass balance approach to investigate this for nine catchments in the UCRB. We found that snow sustains not only most the streamflow but also ¾ of the ET. Rainfall was mostly (2/3) lost to the atmosphere through ET. The variation of the snow and rain contributions to streamflow and ET were mainly driven by the catchment aspect and tree cover. The findings show that the timing of snowmelt (influenced by aspect) and plant water use (influenced by tree cover) determined how much snow became streamflow and ET. For the mountainous catchments in the Upper Colorado River, the fate of snow (rain) is 33\% (67\%) evapotranspiration (ET) and 13\% (8\%) summer streamflow In catchments with relatively higher tree cover, snow was more likely to evapotranspire with less rain and snow sustaining streamflow Increased rainfall led to greater share of rain in ET rather than streamflow, while snowfall variation had little effect For the mountainous catchments in the Upper Colorado River, the fate of snow (rain) is 33\% (67\%) evapotranspiration (ET) and 13\% (8\%) summer streamflow In catchments with relatively higher tree cover, snow was more likely to evapotranspire with less rain and snow sustaining streamflow Increased rainfall led to greater share of rain in ET rather than streamflow, while snowfall variation had little effect}},

The full tensor of the effective thermal conductivity (keff) was computed from 30 three-dimensional images of the snow microstructure, spanning all types of seasonal snow. Only conduction through ice and interstitial air were considered. The obtained values are strongly correlated to snow density. The main cause for the slight scatter around the regression curve to snow density is the anisotropy of keff: the vertical component of keff of facetted crystals and depth hoar samples is up to 1.5 times larger than the horizontal component, while rounded grains sampled deeply in the snowpack exhibit the inverse behavior. Results of simulations neglecting the conduction in the interstitial air indicate that this phase plays a vital role in heat conduction through snow. The computed effective thermal conductivity is found to increase with decreasing temperature, mostly following the temperature dependency of the thermal conductivity of ice. The results are compared to experimental data obtained either with the needle-probe technique or using combined measurements of the vertical heat flux and the corresponding temperature gradient. Needle-probe measurements are systematically significantly lower than those from the two other techniques.

We trained random forest models using combinations of multispectral bands and normalized difference indices (i.e., NDVI) to produce land cover maps for priority feature classes (snow, shaded snow, vegetation, water, and exposed ground). We then created snow-covered area products from these maps and compared them with coarser resolution satellite fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) products from Landsat (\textbackslashtextasciitilde30 m) and MODIS (\textbackslashtextasciitilde500 m). Our models generated accurate classifications, even with limited combinations of available multispectral bands. Models trained on a single image demonstrated limited model transfer, with best results found for in-region transfers. Coarser-resolution Landsat and MODSCAG fSCA products identified many more pixels as completely snow-covered (100\% fSCA) than WV fSCA. However, while MODSCAG fSCA products also identified many more completely snow-free pixels (0\% fSCA) than WV fSCA, Landsat fSCA products only slightly underestimated the number of completely snow-free pixels. Overall, our results demonstrate that strategic image observations with VHR satellites such as WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 can complement the existing operational snow data products to map the evolution of seasonal snow cover.}},

Multilooking or spatial averaging is commonly used to reduce stochastic noise over a neighborhood of distributed scatterers in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements. However, multilooking may break consistency among a triplet of interferometric phases formed from three acquisitions leading to a residual phase error called closure phase. Understanding the cause of closure phase in multilooked InSAR measurements and the impact of closure phase errors on the performance of InSAR time-series algorithms is crucial for quantifying the uncertainty of ground displacement time series derived from InSAR measurements. We develop a model that consistently explains both closure phase and systematic bias in multilooked interferometric measurements. We show that nonzero closure phase can be an indicator of temporally inconsistent physical processes that alter both phase and amplitude of interferometric measurements. We propose a method to estimate the systematic bias in the InSAR time series with generalized closure phase measurements. We validate our model with a case study in Barstow-Bristol Trough, CA, USA. We find systematic differences on the order of cm/year between InSAR time-series results using subsets of varying maximum temporal baselines.

The particles have discrete permittivities that are different from the background medium. The dense-medium model has been applied to the microwave remote sensing of terrestrial snow. In this paper, we propose a different approach of using a bicontinuous medium with discrete permittivities and study the EM scattering properties using analytical and numerical methods. The bicontinuous medium is a continuous representation of interfaces between inhomogeneities within the medium. Discrete permittivities are then assigned to the inhomogeneities of the structure. The analytical approach is based on the Born approximation using the derived analytical correlation functions. The numerical method is based on the numerical Maxwell model of 3-D (NMM3D) approach. In particular, the discrete-dipole approximation and the conjugate gradient-squared method accelerated by the fast Fourier transform technique are used in solving the volume integral equation. Scattering results of analytical and numerical approaches are compared. Numerical results are illustrated using parameters in microwave remote sensing of terrestrial snow. In the NMM3D simulations, three kinds of convergence tests are conducted, viz., convergence with respect to the discretization size, convergence with respect to the sample size, and convergence with respect to the number of realization. The NMM3D results indicate that the scattering by the bicontinuous medium with a broader size distribution has a weaker frequency dependence than that by the medium with a more narrow size distribution. The frequency-dependence power law index can be lower than two, which is very much lower than the power of four in Rayleigh scattering. The NMM3D results also exhibit fairly large cross-polarization returns which account for the local nonisotropic microstructures of bicontinuous media, although the medium is statistically isotropic.}},

In this theoretical study, we examine the sensitivities of microwave radar measurements to soil and snow characteristics, and we compare a simple model with previously published data.

These measurements can reduce the number of unknowns in any corresponding higher‐frequency observations that are also affected by the lower boundary condition. The copolarized ratio is sensitive, first of all, to the snow density, which offers the possibility of measuring this parameter directly if a separate measurement of the soil temperature from a passive microwave system is also available. The thermal insulation provided by snow cover can have a powerful effect on the soil‐snow boundary by altering the soil temperature and therefore changing the dielectric contrast. Because the microwave response of snow cover is so sensitive to the conditions of the underlying frozen soil, it is important for future ground truth campaigns that measure snow conditions to also collect data on the temperature, water content, and texture of the soil.}},

In situ measurements of snow and soil properties from four field campaigns during two different winters (March and November 2018, January and March 2019) were compared to an ensemble of CLM5.0 (Community Land Model) simulations, at Trail Valley Creek, Northwest Territories, Canada. Snow MicroPenetrometer profiles allowed snowpack density and thermal conductivity to be derived at higher vertical resolution (1.25 mm) and a larger sample size (n = 1050) compared to traditional snowpit observations (3 cm vertical resolution; n = 115). Comparing measurements with simulations shows CLM overestimated snow thermal conductivity by a factor of 3, leading to a cold bias in wintertime soil temperatures (RMSE = 5.8 °C). Bias-correction of the simulated thermal conductivity (relative to field measurements) improved simulated soil temperatures (RMSE = 2.1 °C). Multiple linear regression shows the required correction factor is strongly related to snow depth (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 0.066) particularly early in the winter. Furthermore, CLM simulations did not adequately represent the observed high proportions of depth hoar. Addressing uncertainty in simulated snow properties and the corresponding heat flux is important, as wintertime soil temperatures act as a control on subnivean soil respiration, and hence impact Arctic winter carbon fluxes and budgets.}},

The global snow science community estimates snow cover and mass with information from land surface models, numerical weather prediction, satellite observations, surface measurements, and combinations thereof. Accurate estimation of snow at the spatial and temporal scales over which snow varies has historically been challenged by the complexity of land cover and terrain and the large global extent of snow-covered regions. Like many Earth science disciplines, snow science is in an era of rapid advances as remote sensing products and models continue to gain granularity and physical fidelity. Despite clear progress, the snow science community continues to face challenges related to the accuracy of seasonal snow estimation. Namely, advances in snow modeling remain limited by uncertainties in modeling parameterization schemes and input forcings, and advances in remote sensing techniques remain limited by temporal, spatial, and technical constraints on the variables that can be observed. Accurate monitoring and modeling of snow improves our ability to assess Earth system conditions, trends, and future projections while serving highly valued global interests in water supply and weather forecasts. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand and improve the errors and uncertainties associated with estimates of snow. A potential method to overcome model and observational shortcomings is data assimilation, which leverages the information content in both observations and models while minimizing their limitations due to uncertainty. This article proposes data assimilation as a way to reduce uncertainties in the characterization of seasonal snow changes and reviews current modeling, remote sensing, and data assimilation techniques applied to the estimation of seasonal snow. Finally, remaining challenges for seasonal snow estimation are discussed.}},

The phase dependence was significant (at a significance level of 0.05) for more than 70\% of the fields at HH polarization, its sign corresponding to an increase in optical path upon wetting, and the magnitude of the associated deformation commonly exceeding 2cm for a change in soil moisture of 20\%. This trend was similar in both campaigns, whereas the prevalence of soil moisture-related decorrelation differs. These results are only consistent with a dielectric origin of the soil moisture effects, and not with soil swelling or the penetration depth hypothesis.

Yet today little is known about the temporal evolution of snow permeability as a function of metamorphic regime. Furthermore, our ability to simulate snow permeability over the seasonal evolution of a snowpack has not been tested. Here we have measured the evolution of snow permeability in a subarctic snowpack subject to high temperature-gradient (TG) metamorphism. We have also measured the evolution of the same snowpack deposited over tables so that it evolved in the equi-temperature (ET) regime. Permeability varies in the range 31 × 10−10 (ET regime) to 650 × 10−10 m2 (TG regime). Permeability increases over time in TG conditions and decreases under ET conditions. Using measurements of density ρ and of specific surface area (SSA), from which the equivalent sphere radius r is determined, we show that the equation linking SSA, density ρ and permeability, K = 3.0 r2 e(−0.013 ρ) (with K in m2, r in m and ρ in kg m−3) obtained in a previous study adequately predicts permeability values. The detailed snowpack model Crocus is used to simulate the physical properties of the TG and ET snowpacks. For the most part, all variables are well reproduced. Simulated permeabilities are up to a factor of two greater than measurements for depth hoar layers, which we attribute to snow microstructure and its aerodynamic properties. Finally, the large difference in permeabilities between ET and TG metamorphic regimes will impact atmosphere-snow energy and mass exchanges. These effects deserve consideration in predicting the effect of climate change on snow properties and snow–atmosphere interactions.}},

In addition to widely applied backscattering-based method, thanks to the advancements of spaceborne SAR sensors and image processing techniques, many new approaches based on interferometric SAR (InSAR) and polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) have been developed since the launch of ERS-1 in 1991 to monitor snow cover under both dry and wet snow conditions.

In this work we use a recurrent convolutional neural network to estimate snow depth at high spatial resolution (10 m GSD), weekly, and at large scale based on satellite data sources and elevation maps, without the need for measurement stations on the ground. The proposed method achieves unprecedented results for large-scale, high-resolution snow depth mapping. The resulting maps are evaluated over a period of three years against high-fidelity snow depth maps obtained with airborne photogrammetry.

Field measurements of snow and firn density, permeability and microstructure are presented and compared with measurements from previous years. Density and permeability profiles follow similar general patterns from year to year; however, the specifics of the profiles show interannual variation. Field measurements of the diffusion of an inert tracer gas, SF6, through the surface wind pack yields an SF6 diffusion coefficient for the June 2000 surface wind pack at Summit of ∼0.06cm2/s; the tortuosity of the surface wind pack was 0.5. The first direct measurements of interstitial air flow in snow due to natural ventilation in undisturbed snow are presented, for light (3m/s) winds and moderately strong (9m/s) winds in a hoar layer 15cm beneath the surface. The measurements during light winds showed results characteristic of diffusion profiles, while the measurements under strong winds showed evidence of ventilation.

One disadvantage is the often coarse spatial resolution of tens of kilometers of products retrieved from microwave observations from spaceborne radiometers and scatterometers. This can potentially be overcome by using new high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations from Sentinel-1. However, the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 backscatter to vegetation dynamics, or its use in radiative transfer models, such as the water cloud model, has only been tested at field to regional scale. In this study, we compared the cross-polarization ratio (CR) to vegetation dynamics as observed in microwave-based Vegetation Optical Depth from coarse-scale satellites over Europe. CR was obtained from Sentinel-1 VH and VV backscatter observations at 500 m sampling and resampled to the spatial resolution of VOD from the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) on-board the Metop satellite series. Spatial patterns between median CR and ASCAT VOD correspond to each other and to vegetation patterns over Europe. Analysis of temporal correlation between CR and ASCAT VOD shows that high Pearson correlation coefficients (Rp) are found over croplands and grasslands (median Rp > 0.75). Over deciduous broadleaf forests, negative correlations are found. This is attributed to the effect of structural changes in the vegetation canopy which affect CR and ASCAT VOD in different ways. Additional analysis comparing CR to passive microwave-based VOD shows similar effects in deciduous broadleaf forests and high correlations over crop- and grasslands. Though the relationship between CR and VOD over deciduous forests is unclear, results suggest that CR is useful for monitoring vegetation dynamics over crop- and grassland and a potential path to high-resolution VOD.}},

In this study we compared numerical model output with observed stability. Overall, 775 snow profiles combined with Rutschblock scores and release types for the area surrounding five weather stations were rated into three stability classes. Snow stratigraphy data were then produced for the locations of these five weather stations using the snow cover model SNOWPACK. We observed that (i) an existing physically based stability interpretation implemented in SNOWPACK was applicable for regional stability evaluation; (ii) modelled variables equivalent to those manually observed variables found to be significantly discriminatory with regard to stability, did not demonstrated equal strength of classification; (iii) additional modelled variables that cannot be measured in the field discriminated well between stability categories. Finally, with objective feature selection, a set of variables was chosen to establish an optimal link between the modelled snow stratigraphy data and the stability rating through the use of classification trees. Cross-validation was then used to assess the quality of the classification trees. A true skill statistic of 0.5 and 0.4 was achieved by two models that detected “rather stable” or “rather unstable” conditions, respectively. The interpretation derived could be further developed into a support tool for avalanche warning services for the prediction of regional avalanche danger.}},

These 30-arcsec (∼800-m) grids are the official spatial climate data sets of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) interpolation method was used to develop data sets that reflected, as closely as possible, the current state of knowledge of spatial climate patterns in the United States. PRISM calculates a climate–elevation regression for each digital elevation model (DEM) grid cell, and stations entering the regression are assigned weights based primarily on the physiographic similarity of the station to the grid cell. Factors considered are location, elevation, coastal proximity, topographic facet orientation, vertical atmospheric layer, topographic position, and orographic effectiveness of the terrain. Surface stations used in the analysis numbered nearly 13 000 for precipitation and 10 000 for temperature. Station data were spatially quality controlled, and short-period-of-record averages adjusted to better reflect the 1971–2000 period. PRISM interpolation uncertainties were estimated with cross-validation (C-V) mean absolute error (MAE) and the 70\% prediction interval of the climate–elevation regression function. The two measures were not well correlated at the point level, but were similar when averaged over large regions. The PRISM data set was compared with the WorldClim and Daymet spatial climate data sets. The comparison demonstrated that using a relatively dense station data set and the physiographically sensitive PRISM interpolation process resulted in substantially improved climate grids over those of WorldClim and Daymet. The improvement varied, however, depending on the complexity of the region. Mountainous and coastal areas of the western United States, characterized by sparse data coverage, large elevation gradients, rain shadows, inversions, cold air drainage, and coastal effects, showed the greatest improvement. The PRISM data set benefited from a peer review procedure that incorporated local knowledge and data into the development process. Copyright © 2008 Royal Meteorological Society}},

We find hotspots primarily in high-mountain Asia (the Tibetan Plateau), Central Asia, western Russia, western US and the southern Andes.

abstract = {{The spaceborne aperture radar (SAR) technique based on a combination of P-band signals of opportunity (SoOp) reflectometry with a sparse array of receivers at low earth orbits (LEOs) and transmit signals from the United States Navy's Mobile User Objective System operating on a geosynchronous altitude has been analyzed. The design focuses on the forward-looking geometry near the specular direction, which allows a high surface reflectivity, in order to obtain adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with a moderate receiving antenna gain. The sparse array is utilized to sharpen the across-track resolution and reduce the iso-range ambiguity. The formulation for match filtering and illustrations of point target response are presented. This work shows that an array of five to seven receivers is able to achieve an across-track resolution of about 200m in the outer portion of swath and about 1km in the center part of swath. The along-track resolution can reach 10m or better due to the feasibility of a long dwell time for Doppler filtering. We find that the sparse array allows the reduction of the iso-range ambiguity to a level of lower than 5 for a major portion of swath, 70 or greater depending on the number of receivers and spacing. We have completed an SNR formulation, which can consistently account for both coherent and incoherent scattering regardless the spatial resolution. An analysis of SNR based on the Kirchhoff approximation for rough surface scattering has been performed. We find that it is possible to obtain a swath width of 100km with an SNR of 5dB or better for a constellation of seven satellites with a receiving antenna directivity of 15dBi at a LEO altitude of 675km for a wide range of surface roughness. Our study suggests the promise of the SoOpSAR concept for high-resolution remote sensing of land surfaces.}},

The two infrasound arrays separated by \textbackslashtextasciitilde103 m and possessing \textbackslashtextasciitilde101.5 m apertures permit efficient triangulation for explosion triggers and moving snow avalanche sources occurring within about 2000 m from the arrays. During the 2018 season, we detect
moving sound sources from hundreds of snow avalanches corresponding to class 1 and 2 avalanches. In many cases we are able to track the sound source(s) traveling down well-known slide paths for more than a kilometer and with speeds up to about 101 m/s, which we consider as a lower bounds on the actual speed of the advancing flow front. Although three arrays were deployed in 2018 and each comprised four infrasonic microphones, we demonstrate that a subset of four sensors (distributed
between two arrays) is especially well suited for quick processing, effective detection, and precise location of the moving avalanche sources. We provide recommendations on the most effective topologies and processing techniques for monitoring avalanche-prone transportation corridors such as

Phase differences of 5-15 deg/10 cm fresh snow were determined at a frequency of 9.65 GHz by comparing spatial and temporal variations of snow depth (SD) with the CPD. Spatial correlations were derived from snow transect measurements during January 2012 and TanDEM-X acquisitions. Temporal correlations were derived from weather station data and TerraSAR-X acquisitions between December 2012 and April 2013. All measurements were done at a test field near the city Sodankylae, Finland. To explain the observed CPD, a model derives birefringent properties from the microstructure of snow, which is described as aligned elliptical particles. The microscopic description is based on computer tomography observations. Different incidence angles were analyzed in consistency with the model. The temporal evolution of the CPD was linked to the temperature-gradient-driven recrystallization process. Sudden increases in the CPD indicate fresh snow. Slow decreases indicate the subsequent recrystallization process. The background signal of wet soil was considered and causes a small negative offset to the CPD. A quantitative determination of the depth of fresh snow is possible, because the specific CPD per meter of snow can be estimated. Spatial resolutions below 100×100 m are achievable with sensors such as TerraSAR-X or TanDEM-X. This paper presents a theoretical relationship between the microstructure of snow and the CPD and relates the CPD theoretically and empirically to the depth of fresh snow.}},

For the 3 years, satellite‐derived estimates captured a decrease in mean April snow depth (∼2.50 cm) and ice thickness (∼0.28 m) equivalent to an ice volume loss of ∼12.5\%. Results show greater thinning of multiyear ice with an end‐of‐season thickness in 2021 that is lower by ∼16.1\% (0.50 m), with negligible changes over first‐year ice. For the period, sea ice thickness estimates using snow depth from climatology result in thicker ice (by up to ∼0.22 m) with a smaller decrease in multiyear ice thickness (∼0.38 m). An 18‐year satellite record, since the launch of ICESat, points to a loss of ∼6,000 km3 or one‐third of the winter Arctic ice volume driven by decline in multiyear‐ice coverage in the multi‐decadal transition to a largely seasonal ice cover. Ice thickness and volume are critical variables for assessing the evolution and response of the polar sea ice cover to a warming climate. Retrieval of sea ice thickness from altimeter freeboards (i.e., the vertical height of the floating ice and snow above the local sea level) requires knowledge of loading due to snow. Until recently, snow depth has been prescribed with a climatology based on historical field records. Using freeboard differences from ICESat‐2 and CryoSat‐2, we are now able to derive snow depth estimates. In this paper we examine the differences between climatological and satellite‐derived snow depth as well as the retrieved ice thicknesses from the two altimeter missions. Their changes for three winters between 2018 and 2021 are documented. Derived ice volume estimates are placed within the context of an 18‐year satellite record. For 2018–2021, the decline in mean Arctic sea ice thickness of ∼0.28 m in spring is largely explained by ∼0.50 m thinning of multiyear ice Satellite‐derived snow depth estimates, when compared to climatology, provide a thinner Arctic ice thickness especially during the fall Satellite records since 2003 show a loss of one‐third of the winter sea ice volume driven by the decline in multiyear ice coverage For 2018–2021, the decline in mean Arctic sea ice thickness of ∼0.28 m in spring is largely explained by ∼0.50 m thinning of multiyear ice Satellite‐derived snow depth estimates, when compared to climatology, provide a thinner Arctic ice thickness especially during the fall Satellite records since 2003 show a loss of one‐third of the winter sea ice volume driven by the decline in multiyear ice coverage}},

abstract = {{The main limiting factor on the accuracy of Interferometric SAR measurements (InSAR) comes from phase propagation delays through the troposphere. The delay can be divided into a stratified component, which correlates with the topography and often dominates the tropospheric signal, and a turbulent component. We use Global Atmospheric Models (GAM) to estimate the stratified phase delay and delay-elevation ratio at epochs of SAR acquisitions, and compare them to observed phase delay derived from SAR interferograms. Three test areas are selected with different geographic and climatic environments and with large SAR archive available. The Lake Mead, Nevada, USA is covered by 79 ERS1/2 and ENVISAT acquisitions, the Haiyuan Fault area, Gansu, China, by 24 ERS1/2 acquisitions, and the Afar region, Republic of Djibouti, by 91 Radarsat acquisitions. The hydrostatic and wet stratified delays are computed from GAM as a function of atmospheric pressure P, temperature T, and water vapor partial pressure e vertical profiles. The hydrostatic delay, which depends on ratio P/T, varies significantly at low elevation and cannot be neglected. The wet component of the delay depends mostly on the near surface specific humidity. GAM predicted delay-elevation ratios are in good agreement with the ratios derived from InSAR data away from deforming zones. Both estimations of the delay-elevation ratio can thus be used to perform a first order correction of the observed interferometric phase to retrieve a ground motion signal of low amplitude. We also demonstrate that aliasing of daily and seasonal variations in the stratified delay due to uneven sampling of SAR data significantly bias InSAR data stacks or time series produced after temporal smoothing. In all three test cases, the InSAR data stacks or smoothed time series present a residual stratified delay of the order of the expected deformation signal. In all cases, correcting interferograms from the stratified delay removes all these biases. We quantify the standard error associated with the correction of the stratified atmospheric delay. It varies from one site to another depending on the prevailing atmospheric conditions, but remains bounded by the standard deviation of the daily fluctuations of the stratified delay around the seasonal average. Finally we suggest that the phase delay correction can potentially be improved by introducing a non-linear dependence to the elevation derived from GAM.}},

Average values ranged from 0.078 W m−1 K−1 for new snow to 0.290 W m−1 K−1 for an ubiquitous wind slab. ks increased with increasing density, consistent with published equations, but could also be reliably estimated from the metamorphic state of the snow. Using measured values of ks and snow stratigraphy, the average bulk value for the full snowpack was 0.14 W m−1 K−1. In contrast, ks inferred from ice growth and temperature gradients in the snow was 0.33 W m−1 K−1. The mismatch arises in part because the second estimate is based on measurements from an aggregate scale that includes enhanced heat flow due to two- and three-dimensional snow and ice geometry. A finite element model suggests that the complex geometry produces areas of concentrated heat loss at the snow surface. These “hot spots,” however, increase the apparent conductivity only by a factor of 1.4, not enough to fully explain the mismatch. Nonconductive heat transfer mechanisms, like natural and forced air convection, may also be operating in the snowpack, though the ubiquitous presence of low permeability wind slabs potentially limits their effectiveness. The relative contributions of effects due to snow and ice geometric and nonconductive processes within the snowpack remain uncertain.}},

For the southernmost range (the White Mountains), spring snow at most elevations will disappear by the end of the twenty-first century. We investigate soil and fuel moisture changes for the five mountain ranges and for six lowland regions. The accelerated depletion of mountain snowpack due to warming leads to reduced summer soil moisture across mountain environments. Similarly, warmer and drier summers lead to decreases of up to 25\% in dead fuel moisture across all mountain ranges. Collective declines in spring mountain snowpack, summer soil moisture, and fuel moisture across western mountain ranges will increase fire potential in flammability-limited forested systems where fuels are not limiting. Projected changes in fire potential in predominately fuel-limited systems at lower elevations are more uncertain given the confounding signals between projected changes in soil moisture and fuel moisture.}},

In this paper, the one-dimensional equations governing the heat transfer, water transport, vapour diffusion and mechanical deformation of a phase changing snowpack are stated. New snow, wind drift and snow ablation are treated as special mass boundary conditions. Snow is modelled as a three-component (ice, water, air) porous material capable of undergoing large irreversible viscous deformations. Phase changes between the components are simulated. Snow layers are defined not only in terms of height and density, but also microstructure. That is, by the size, shape and bonding of the grains composing the ice lattice. The governing differential equations are solved using a fully implicit Lagrangian Gauss–Seidel finite-element method. Example calculations from the catastrophic avalanche winter 1999 are presented to document model performance. The overall mass balance evaluation shows that the model accurately predicts the build-up and ablation of the seasonal alpine snowcover.}},

The main scattering contribution from a dry snow cover is from the snow–ground interface. Thus, the interferometric phase of two SAR images, one with no snow and one with dry snow cover, contains information on the SWE. By performing a delta-K processing of the two SAR scenes followed by averaging, an estimation of the SWE can be achieved. The first step in the delta-K InSAR processing is to split the band into two nonoverlapping subfrequency band images. The resulting two subband images then contain two new carrier frequencies with a small delta frequency or delta-K separation. The next step is to multiply the two subband images together to obtain the delta-K image, one for summer and one for winter. Finally, the delta-K interferometric SAR image is generated by multiplying the two delta-K images from summer and winter together.

abstract = {{Cold content is a measure of a snowpack's energy deficit and is a linear function of snowpack mass and temperature. Positive energy fluxes into a snowpack must first satisfy the remaining energy deficit before snowmelt runoff begins, making cold content a key component of the snowpack energy budget. Nevertheless, uncertainty surrounds cold content development and its relationship to snowmelt, likely because of a lack of direct observations. This work clarifies the controls exerted by air temperature, precipitation, and negative energy fluxes on cold content development and quantifies the relationship between cold content and snowmelt timing and rate at daily to seasonal timescales. The analysis presented herein leverages a unique long-term snow pit record along with validated output from the SNOWPACK model forced with 23 water years (1991–2013) of quality controlled, infilled hourly meteorological data from an alpine and subalpine site in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. The results indicated that precipitation exerted the primary control on cold content development at our two sites with snowfall responsible for 84.4 and 73.0 \% of simulated daily gains in the alpine and subalpine, respectively. A negative surface energy balance – primarily driven by sublimation and longwave radiation emission from the snowpack – during days without snowfall provided a secondary pathway for cold content development, and was responsible for the remaining 15.6 and 27.0 \% of cold content additions. Non-zero cold content values were associated with reduced snowmelt rates and delayed snowmelt onset at daily to sub-seasonal timescales, while peak cold content magnitude had no significant relationship to seasonal snowmelt timing. These results suggest that the information provided by cold content observations and/or simulations is most relevant to snowmelt processes at shorter timescales, and may help water resource managers to better predict melt onset and rate.}},

We show that in a 4 km2 wind exposed area on the west end of Grand Mesa, the measured change in phase can be used to estimate change in snow depth. In this region we observed both scouring and drifting, with a dynamic range of ± 20 cm. We use the measured surface density, change in phase, and local incidence angle to estimate change in snow depth over approximately a 2 week period, with a RMSD of 4.7cm depth, and 0.9cm SWE.

abstract = {{Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA‐Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA‐Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3‐hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set‐up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re‐forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA‐Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global‐mean correlation with monthly‐mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low‐frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA‐Interim, MERRA‐2 and JRA‐55 reanalyses. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the ERA5 global reanalysis from 1979 onwards, which is produced at ECMWF as part of the Copernicus Climate Change Service. It provides a detailed record of the three‐dimensional atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves at an hourly temporal resolution. Compared to its predecessor ERA‐Interim, ERA5 has a much‐increased horizontal resolution and benefits from 10 more years of R\&D, which includes an uncertainty estimate from an underlying ensemble of 4D‐Var data assimilation systems.}},

The flow may only be strong enough to disrupt the temperature field for features of wavelengths on the scale of meters or tens of meters at wind speeds of 10 m/s or more. Other possible causes of windpumping have been examined but they do not appear to be as significant. Rapid pressure perturbations due to turbulence produce very little displacement of the air because of the high frequency and low amplitude.

All western U.S. ecoregions showed significant relationships between the timing of PSM and DSD. Changes in the timing of PSM based on warming predicted for the middle and end of the 21st century ranged from 1 to 9 days and from 6 to 17 days among ecoregions, respectively. The maritime ecoregions PSM timing were 2–3 times more sensitive to warming and drying versus the interior mountain ecoregions. This work suggests that soil hydrology modifies the effects of earlier snowmelt on regional streamflow response and vegetation water stress.

Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology offers the ability to monitor snow cover in all weather.

In this method, RadarSat-2 InSAR interferometric coherence images are analyzed, adopting snow-covered and snow-free areas obtained from GF-1 satellite observations as the “ground truth.” The analysis results indicate that the coherence in copolarizations is clearly correlated with the underlying surface type and local incidence angle. These two factors, combined with training samples from GF-1 wide field viewer data, were used to build an SVM to classify coherence images in HH polarization. The classification results demonstrate that snow cover extraction using this method can achieve mean accuracies of 83.8\% and 77.5\% in areas with low and high vegetation coverage, respectively. These accuracies are significantly higher than those achieved by the typical thresholding algorithm (72.7\% and 69.2\%, respectively).}},

The main scattering contribution from a dry snow cover is from the snow-ground interface. However, the radar wave will be refracted in the snow. Thus, only small changes in the snow properties between two interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images will change the interferometric phase. This phase change is shown to introduce a significantly increase in the digital elevation model (DEM) height error, although no effects are observed on the degree of coherence. The phase change is also shown to affect the differential interferometric results and may wrongly be interpreted as range displacement. The presented theory and results implies that light snowfall and/or small changes in snow properties between interferometric SAR (InSAR) image acquisitions, may introduce significant height errors in DEM derived from glaciers, ice sheets, or bare ground, even in the case of high degree of coherence. Thus, meteorological observations in addition to degree of coherence must be considered when generating DEM in areas covered with snow or where snow fall is likely to have occurred.}},

Several automated or semi-automated detection technologies have been developed in the past among which infrasound-based detection is the most promising for regional-scale avalanche monitoring. However, due to significant ambient noise content in infrasonic signals, e.g. from atmospheric processes or airplanes, fully automated and reliable avalanche detection has been very challenging. Signal processing is highly critical and strongly affects detection accuracy. Here, a robust detection method by using supervised machine learning is introduced. Machine learning algorithms can take into account multiple signal features and statistically optimize the classification task. We analyzed infrasound data with concurrent visual avalanche observations from the test site Lavin (Eastern Swiss Alps) for the winter of 2011–2012. A support vector machine was trained by using training data from the first half of the winter season and the accuracy was tested on data from the second half of the season. A significant reduction of false detections, from 65\% to 10\%, was achieved compared to a threshold-based classifier provided by the sensor manufacturer. The proposed method enables reliable assessment of the avalanche activity in the surroundings of the system and paves the way towards robust and fully automated avalanche detection using infrasonic systems.}},

A new multilayer snow scheme is implemented in the European Centre for Medium‐range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System and its impact on snow and 2‐m temperature forecasts is evaluated. The new snow scheme is evaluated offline at well‐instrumented field sites and compared to the current single‐layer scheme. The new scheme largely improves the representation of snow depth for most of the sites considered, reducing the root‐mean‐square error averaged over all sites by more than 30\%. The improvements are due to a better description of snow density in thick and cold snowpacks, but also due to an improved representation of sporadic melting episodes because of the inclusion of a thin top snow layer with a low thermal inertia. The evaluation of coupled 10‐day weather forecasts shows an improved representation of snow depth at all lead times, demonstrating a positive impact at the global scale. Regarding the impact on weather parameters, the multilayer snow scheme improves the simulated minimum 2‐m temperature, by decreasing the positive bias and improving the amplitude of the diurnal cycle over snow‐covered regions. However, the increased variability of the 2‐m temperature can have a detrimental impact in regions characterized by preexisting errors in the daily mean temperature, associated with errors in cloud processes or surface albedo.

Snow depth derived from ATL06 data only (snow-on and snow-off) offers a poor temporal and spatial coverage, limiting its potential utility. However, using a digital terrain model from airborne lidar surveys as the snow-off elevation source yielded a snow depth accuracy of ∼ 0.2 m (bias) and precision of ∼ 1 m (random error) across the basin, with an improved precision of 0.5 m for low slopes (< 10∘), compared to eight reference airborne lidar snow depth maps.

The microstructure of the media is controlled by two parameters: mean grain size \$\textbackslashlangle \textbackslashzeta \textbackslashrangle \$ and aggregation parameter \$\{b\}\$ . Phase matrices and extinction coefficients are computed with full-wave simulations. These are then substituted into radiative transfer (RT) equations to obtain backscattering coefficients of the dense media layer with particle clusters. The backscattering has a weaker frequency dependence (e.g., \$\textbackslashsim \$ 2.6 power for \$\{b\}=\textbackslashmathbf \{0\}.\textbackslashmathbf \{4\}\$ ) than the Rayleigh scattering of fourth power. Backscattering results exhibit strong co-, cross-polarization (pol), and ratio of cross- to co-polarization. For applications to remote sensing of terrestrial snow at C-band, the results of DMRT simulations show that cross-polarization of snow volume scattering can be larger than that of soil surface scattering. Recently, this property of strong cross-polarization has become a useful satellite remote sensing technique for global retrieval of snow depth. Comparisons of DMRT results are made with ESA Satellite Sentinel 1 C-band data and ground-based radar observations. The calculated backscatter is in good agreement with radar measurements for both the co- and cross-polarization.}},

A numerical method based on the method of moments is used as a gauge for comparison with the theoretical methods. After deriving the 2-D quasi-crystalline approximation and presenting the numerical method, the behavior of the effective permittivity is analyzed for a range of particle sizes, volume fractions and dielectric losses. From this analysis, regions of validity for the theoretical methods are determined. An investigation is also given which explores the effect of particle arrangement methods on the pair distribution function which, in turn, is shown to have a significant effect on the imaginary component of the effective permittivity.}},

abstract = {{In the 1998‐1999 winter, the operational feasibility of using RADARSAT SAR data to estimate the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) in a large hydroelectric complex managed by Hydro‐Québec (La Grande River watershed) has been successfully demonstrated. This watershed is located in the subarctic climatic region in the north‐west of the Québec province. The vegetation consists of moderately dense to open Black Spruce forests, open lands, burned lands and peat bogs. In the last few years, an original approach well adapted for this region has been developed to estimate the SWE from SAR data (ERS‐1, RADARSAT). This approach is based on the fact that the snow cover characteristics influence the underlying soil temperature which influences the dielectric properties of the soil and then the recorded backscattering signal. Then, a linear relationship between the backscattering ratios of a winter image and a snow‐free (fall) image, and the snowpack thermal resistance (thermal insulation properties) has been established. Consequently, the algorithm infers the SWE from the estimated thermal resistance and the measured mean density of the snowpack. This algorithm has been implemented within a MapInfo™ application that has been named EQeau. It allows mapping of the spatial distribution of the estimated SWE at the desired level (pixel, square grid, sub‐watershed). During the 1998‐1999 winter, EQeau has been used successfully in a pre‐operational mode using calibrated Wide beam images (W1) from RADARSAT. The algorithm has given mean estimated SWE values similar to the SWE values derived from Hydro‐Quebec snow transects (relative difference between 1\% and 13\%). Also, the SWE increase measured from January to March 1999 is clearly detected on the maps covering almost 77 000 km2. The next steps will be the evaluation of the ScanSAR images and the demonstration of the economical advantages of using RADARSAT data in a hydrological forecasting system.

The release of NLCD 2016 provides important new information on land change patterns across CONUS from 2001 to 2016. For land cover, seven epochs were concurrently generated for years 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2013, and 2016. Products reveal that land cover change is significant across most land cover classes and time periods. The land cover product was validated using existing reference data from the legacy NLCD 2011 accuracy assessment, applied to the 2011 epoch of the NLCD 2016 product line. The legacy and new NLCD 2011 overall accuracies were 82\% and 83\%, respectively, (standard error (SE) was 0.5\%), demonstrating a small but significant increase in overall accuracy. Between 2001 and 2016, the CONUS landscape experienced significant change, with almost 8\% of the landscape having experienced a land cover change at least once during this period. Nearly 50\% of that change involves forest, driven by change agents of harvest, fire, disease and pests that resulted in an overall forest decline, including increasing fragmentation and loss of interior forest. Agricultural change represented 15.9\% of the change, with total agricultural spatial extent showing only a slight increase of 4778 km2, however there was a substantial decline (7.94\%) in pasture/hay during this time, transitioning mostly to cultivated crop. Water and wetland change comprised 15.2\% of change and represent highly dynamic land cover classes from epoch to epoch, heavily influenced by precipitation. Grass and shrub change comprise 14.5\% of the total change, with most change resulting from fire. Developed change was the most persistent and permanent land change increase adding almost 29,000 km2 over 15 years (5.6\% of total CONUS change), with southern states exhibiting expansion much faster than most of the northern states. Temporal rates of developed change increased in 2001–2006 at twice the rate of 2011–2016, reflecting a slowdown in CONUS economic activity. Future NLCD plans include increasing monitoring frequency, reducing latency time between satellite imaging and product delivery, improving accuracy and expanding the variety of products available in an integrated database.}},

New measurements of with improved accuracy were made with a specially designed resonator operating near 1 GHz. The coaxial sensor accurately defines the sample volume whose actual mass can be determined to give the density of the snow sample. A special electronic instrument, called a resometer, enabled accurate and rapid measurements under field conditions. Some 90 measurements of different kinds of dry snow (fresh, old, wind-pressed snow, depth hear, and refrozen crusts) were made at test sites in the Swiss and Austrian Alps. The data indicate that /spl epsiv/ is a function of snow density only, given that the standard deviation of 0.006 from the fitted curve is just due to the expected measurement errors. The interpretation of these data in terms of physical mixing theory favors the effective medium formula of Polder and van Santen (1946). The data allow to relate the average axial ratio X as a function of ice volume fraction. Both prolate and oblate spheroids can explain the data. Independent reasoning gives preference to oblate particles. In both cases, the axial ratio increases with increasing fraction up to a critical value of 0.33, followed by a decrease at still higher fractions. The destructive metamorphism of slowly compacting snow explains the increase of X, while the following decrease might be due to sintering. So far, no effect on /spl epsiv/ by a liquid-like surface layer on the ice grains at temperatures between -10/spl deg/C and 0/spl deg/C has been observed.}},

title = {{Detection of Nuclear Explosions Using Infrasound Techniques}}, 
abstract = {{The performance of typical IMS infrasound monitoring stations has been examined in detail in order to evaluate the detection capability of the global network for regional and distant nuclear explosions. Three significant problems have been identified: a) problems with the loss of higher frequency signal components in the primary monitoring passband, b) detection problems associated with a low degree of signal coherence between array elements and c) problems with high levels of wind-generated background noise. Loss of higher frequency signal components normally occurs when signal propagation is restricted to a thermospheric waveguide. This problem can often be resolved by ensuring that routine processing algorithms include a long-period passband. Coherence studies show that detection capability for regional and distant explosions may be limited by the small degree of signal correlation between array elements. This problem can be resolved by modifications to the array configuration. Wind-generated background noise is a potentially serious problem at most infrasound monitoring stations. We have developed a new wind-noise-reducing system that effectively eliminates wind-generated noise in the monitoring passband. This system is based on the use of a closed screened enclosure that mechanically degrades turbulent eddies in the atmospheric boundary layer. This system can be used as an effective, stand-alone wind-noise-reducing system that does not require the use of a pipe array.}},

Consequently, snow storage is expected to decrease, which, together with changes in snowmelt rates and timing, might cause reductions in spring and summer low flows. The objectives of this study were (1) to simulate the effect of changing snow storage on low flows during the warm seasons and (2) to relate drought sensitivity to the simulated snow storage changes at different elevations. The Swiss Climate Change Scenarios 2011 data set was used to derive future changes in air temperature and precipitation. A typical bucket‐type catchment model, HBV‐light, was applied to 14 mountain catchments in Switzerland to simulate streamflow and snow in the reference period and three future periods. The largest relative decrease in annual maximum SWE was simulated for elevations below 2,200 m a.s.l. (60–75\% for the period 2070–2099) and the snowmelt season shifted by up to 4 weeks earlier. The relative decrease in spring and summer minimum runoff that was caused by the relative decrease in maximum SWE (i.e., elasticity), reached 40–90\% in most of catchments for the reference period and decreased for the future periods. This decreasing elasticity indicated that the effect of snow on summer low flows is reduced in the future. The fraction of snowmelt runoff in summer decreased by more than 50\% at the highest elevations and almost disappeared at the lowest elevations. This might have large implications on water availability during the summer. In snow‐dominated areas, summer low flows will significantly decrease in the future This decrease will be caused mostly by the decrease in snow storage and the shift of snowmelt season due to the increase in air temperature Low flows at higher elevations are more sensitive to the decrease in snow storage than low flows at lower elevations}},

Methods to detect global snow cover are well advanced and have been applied routinely at local, regional, and global scales. Current snow cover retrieval methods tend to underestimate snow volume because important fractional forest cover and snowpack physical properties are not well parameterized in simple snow parameter retrieval schemes. Building on a static approach to snow depth retrieval, a spatially dynamic algorithm is described that incorporates information about fractional forest cover and snowpack physical development. SSM/I brightness temperatures of land surfaces are calibrated with ground measurements of snow depth through empirical statistical and geostatistical models to produce globally distributed snow depth estimates. The calibration is based on a 4‐year and a one winter season record of daily snow depth and SSM/I observations. The biasing effect of forest cover on microwave estimates is quantified and short‐term fluctuations of microwave‐estimated snow depth (caused by physical changes in the pack) are reduced by time smoothing daily estimated snow depth values. For the data sets used the estimated snow depth from the new algorithm gives global seasonal errors of 13.7 and 22.1 cm for the two data sets. Further major improvements in snow depth retrieval methods will only be achieved through enhancements to forest and snow metamorphism parameterizations.}},

The sensor consumes a minimum of 24 mW and operates with voltages above 8 V while drawing 3 mA of current. The Infra-NMT specifications described above were independently verified using the infrasound test chamber at the Sandia National Laboratories’ (SNL’s) Facility for Acceptance, Calibration, and Testing (FACT), and the following procedures are for comparison calibration against traceable reference stands in voltage and pressure.

Infrasound array processing is used to identify the arrival of seismic‐to‐atmospheric coupled phases and as much as 90 s of infrasound coda. Apparent velocities ranging from seismic speeds to subhorizontal atmospheric sound speeds are attributed to a superposition of coincident waves arriving at the arrays. We find that the arriving infrasound originates from a broad range of back azimuths that deviates from epicentral back azimuth and indicates the ubiquity of secondary radiators for this relatively small earthquake. Secondary radiators, which often locate in regions of elevated topography, are identified using backprojections and earthquake initiation time. Analysis of infrasound sources from proximal earthquakes can be used to map ground shaking distributions, which are important for assessment of earthquake hazards. Earthquakes are known to produce sounds, which encompass frequencies that are both perceptible and below the threshold of human hearing. Low frequency earthquake (infra)sound may be recorded with specialized microphones to understand how earthquakes shake Earth's surface. Our study uses six infrasonic microphone stations to detect and locate sound sources for a magnitude 3.6 earthquake that occurred within 25 km of the stations. The recorded infrasound is produced by ground shaking at both the infrasound stations and also over a wide distribution of areas coinciding with mountain topography. These secondary sources of earthquake sounds occur as seismic waves pass by and the resultant ground shaking perturbs the atmosphere. The identification of infrasound in this study is possible even though the earthquake size is relatively small. A network of arrays is used to locate proximal infrasound sources for a M3.6 Idaho earthquake “Local infrasound” (at recording site) and “secondary infrasound” (from the epicentral region and from elevated topography) are identified Intermediate slowness values are common and are attributed to superposition of subhorizontal and subvertical propagating infrasound}},

What’s more, for preventing the loss of the phase signal caused by the excessive filtering, an iteration filtering operation is also introduced in this new algorithm. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, both a simulated digital elevation model (DEM) interferogram and real SAR deformation interferogram spanning the L’ Aquila earthquake are carried out. The quantitative results from the simulated and real data reveal that up to 79.5\% noises can be reduced by the new filter, indicating 9\%–32\% improvements over the previous local SNR-based Goldstein filter.

This study aimed to quantify the effects of advective transport of CO2 in soil–snow systems on the subdiurnal to diurnal (hours to days) timescale, use an enhanced diffusion model to replicate the effects of CO2 concentration depletions from persistent winds, and use a model–measure pairing to effectively explore what is happening in the field. We took continuous measurements of CO2 concentration gradients and meteorological data at a site in the Cape Breton Highlands of Nova Scotia, Canada, to determine the relationship between wind speeds and CO2 levels in snowpacks. We adapted a soil CO2 diffusion model for the soil–snow system and simulated stepwise changes in transport rate over a broad range of plausible synthetic cases. The goal was to mimic the changes we observed in CO2 snowpack concentration to help elucidate the mechanisms (diffusion, advection) responsible for observed variations. On subdiurnal to diurnal timescales with varying winds and constant snow levels, a strong negative relationship between wind speed and CO2 concentration within the snowpack was often identified. Modelling clearly demonstrated that diffusion alone was unable to replicate the high-frequency CO2 fluctuations, but simulations using above-atmospheric snowpack diffusivities (simulating advective transport within the snowpack) reproduced snow CO2 changes of the observed magnitude and speed. This confirmed that wind-induced ventilation contributed to episodic pulsed emissions from the snow surface and to suppressed snowpack concentrations. This study improves our understanding of winter CO2 dynamics to aid in continued quantification of the annual global C cycle and demonstrates a preference for continuous wintertime CO2 flux measurement systems.}},

In this study we present a method to determine the thermal diffusivity of snow with high temporal resolution using snow temperature profile measurements. High resolution (between 2.5 and 10cm at 1min) temperature measurements from the seasonal snow pack at the Plaine-Morte glacier in Switzerland are used as initial conditions and Neumann (heat flux) boundary conditions to numerically solve the one-dimensional heat equation and iteratively optimize for thermal diffusivity. The implementation of Neumann boundary conditions and a t-test, ensuring statistical significance between solutions of varied thermal diffusivity, are important to help constrain thermal diffusivity such that spurious high and low values as seen with Dirichlet (temperature) boundary conditions are reduced. The results show that time resolved thermal diffusivity can be determined from temperature measurements of seasonal snow and support density-based empirical parameterizations for thermal conductivity.}},

The microscopic phenomena under consideration are heat conduction, vapor diffusion, sublimation, and deposition. The obtained macroscopic equivalent model is described by two coupled transient diffusion equations including a source term arising from phase change at the pore scale. By dimensional analysis, it was shown that the influence of such source terms on the overall transfers can generally not be neglected, except typically under small temperature gradients. The precision and the robustness of the proposed macroscopic modeling were illustrated through 2D numerical simulations. Finally, the effective vapor diffusion tensor arising in the macroscopic modeling was computed on 3D images of snow. The self-consistent formula offers a good estimate of the effective diffusion coefficient with respect to the snow density, within an average relative error of 10\%.

In this study, a one-dimensional finite-element numerical model was developed to analyze the influence of individual snow-specific and climatic factors on the ground thermal regime. The results indicate that the most important factor is snow depth. Snow depths below the threshold value of 0.6 m lack sufficient insulation to prevent low atmospheric temperatures from cooling the soil. The date of first winter snow insulation and variations in mean annual air temperature (MAAT) are also shown to be important. Delays in early-winter snow insulation and in summer snow disappearance are shown to be of approximately equal significance to the ground thermal conditions. Numerical modelling also indicates that the duration of effective thermal resistance of snow cover governs the slope of the linear dependency between MAAT and mean annual ground surface temperatures (MAGST). Consequently, the most direct effect of a long-term rise in air temperatures on ground temperatures is predicted under a thin snow cover with early snowmelt in spring and/or where a large change in the date of total snowmelt occurs, in response to atmospheric warming.}},

Both the MODIS C6.1 and the VIIRS C2 products will be available for download from the National Snow and Ice Data Center beginning in early 2020 with the complete time series available in 2020. To address the need for a cloud-reduced or cloud-free daily SCE product for both MODIS and VIIRS, a daily cloud-gap-filled (CGF) snow-cover algorithm was developed for MODIS C6.1 and VIIRS C2 processing. MOD10A1F (Terra) and MYD10A1F (Aqua) are daily, 500 m resolution CGF SCE map products from MODIS. VNP10A1F is the daily, 375 m resolution CGF SCE map product from VIIRS. These CGF products include quality-assurance data such as cloud-persistence statistics showing the age of the observation in each pixel. The objective of this paper is to introduce the new MODIS and VIIRS standard CGF daily SCE products and to provide a preliminary evaluation of uncertainties in the gap-filling methodology so that the products can be used as the basis for a moderate-resolution Earth science data record (ESDR) of SCE. Time series of the MODIS and VIIRS CGF products have been developed and evaluated at selected study sites in the US and southern Canada. Observed differences, although small, are largely attributed to cloud masking and differences in the time of day of image acquisition. A nearly 3-month time-series comparison of Terra MODIS and S-NPP VIIRS CGF snow-cover maps for a large study area covering all or parts of 11 states in the western US and part of southwestern Canada reveals excellent correspondence between the Terra MODIS and S-NPP VIIRS products, with a mean difference of 11 070 km2, which is ∼0.45 \% of the study area. According to our preliminary validation of the Terra and Aqua MODIS CGF SCE products in the western US study area, we found higher accuracy of the Terra product compared with the Aqua product. The MODIS CGF SCE data record beginning in 2000 has been extended into the VIIRS era, which should last at least through the early 2030s.}},

A surface-based C-band polarimetric data set collected in February 2006 is used to contrast the polarimetric response to sampled conditions of bare frozen ground, cold snow-covered ground, and snow during a Chinook event. Chinook activity is inherently spatially and temporally variable across the region in winter and produces considerable spatial variability of snow-cover physical properties associated with snow–water-equivalent (SWE) estimates. A temporal analysis of polarimetric backscatter sensed during a Chinook-induced ablation event on February 27, 2006 is used to describe the associated changes in snow conditions and scattering mechanisms. Analysis reveals that the polarimetric surface-based C-band scatterometer data respond to changes in snow parameters associated with the specific ground and snow conditions and to the temporal Chinook ablation event. Use of the copolarizations, cross-polarization, depolarization ratio, copolarization ratio, complex copolarization correlation coefficient, and the copolarized phase difference information show promise in describing changes in snow physical parameters, differing ground and snow conditions, and transitional ablation events, based on differing scattering mechanisms. This paper infers that an increase in volume scattering and fluctuations in surface scattering during the Chinook ablation event may be associated with specific physical changes such as density, crystal structure, and permittivity caused by wind speed. This paper has implications for remotely sensed estimations of snow-covered area (SCA) and SWE. Association of SCA and SWE with backscatter coefficients is not explicit in this paper; however, changes in SWE and snow properties are inferentially linked to changes in backscatter.}},

Backscattering coefficients from 1 to 40 GHz, in situ snow–ground SPs, and meteorological data are measured at the Davos-Laret Remote Sensing Field Laboratory (Switzerland). Relative strengths of the snow–ground system’s three primary scattering elements (air–snow interface, snow volume, and snow–ground interface) on backscattering are assessed. An anticorrelation between reasonably high snow wetness and backscattering coefficient is found, especially at higher microwave frequencies. For small amounts of snow wetness, backscatter coefficients at L- and S-bands are intensified via increasing snow volume and snow surface scattering. Snow–ground SPs influence backscattering according to their characteristic time scales of temporal evolution. Under dry snow conditions and at low and intermediate frequencies, ground permittivity is the major influencer of backscatter at a time scale of roughly two weeks. Snowfall is the major influencer of backscatter at a time scale of a few hours to a few days. The findings of this article are valuable to the development of retrieval algorithms using machine learning while maintaining a grasp on the ongoing physical processes. Another key message is that multifrequency active microwave measurements are critical to maximize the number of retrievable SPs and their estimation accuracy. For example, while Ka-band performs well in the detection of snow cover, L-band measurements are more responsive to changes of snow water equivalent (SWE) under moist or wet snow conditions.}},

We present a new data set containing 488 measurements for which the temperature, type and measurement accuracy are known. A quadratic equation,  where ρ is in g cm−3, and K eff is in W m−1K−1, can be fit to the new data (R2 = 0.79). A logarithmic expression,  can also be used. The first regression is better when estimating values beyond the limits of the data; the second when estimating values for low-density snow. Within the data set, snow types resulting from kinetic growth show density-independent behavior. Rounded-grain and wind-blown snow show strong density dependence. The new data set has a higher mean value of density but a lower mean value of thermal conductivity than the old set. This shift is attributed to differences in snow types and sample temperatures in the sets. Using both data sets, we show that there are well-defined limits to the geometric configurations that natural seasonal snow can take.}},

BSA was correlated with simulated baseflow efficiency (r2 = 0.64) and simulated snowmelt rate (r2 = 0.42). The strong correlation between snowmelt rate and baseflow efficiency (r2 = 0.73) links these relationships and supports a possible streamflow generation mechanism wherein greater snowmelt rates increase subsurface flow. Rapid snowmelt may thus bring the soil to field capacity, facilitating below‐root zone percolation, streamflow, and a positive BSA. Previous works have shown that future increases in regional air temperature may lead to earlier, slower snowmelt and hence decreased streamflow production via the mechanism proposed by this work. Snowmelt rate drives subsurface flow and streamflow production across the western U.S. Western U.S. ecoregions have varying streamflow sensitivities to changes in snowmelt rate Earlier, slower snowmelt usually produces less streamflow than more rapid melt}},

It is therefore important to correctly model snow surface temperatures in energy balance snowmelt models. This paper focuses on the relationship between snow surface temperature and conductive energy fluxes that drive the energy balance of a snowpack. Time series of snow temperature at the surface and through the snowpack were measured to examine energy conduction in a snowpack. Based on these measurements we calculated the snowpack energy content and conductive energy flux at the snow surface. We then used these estimates of conductive energy flux to evaluate formulae for the calculation of the conductive flux at the snow surface based on surface temperature time series. We use a method based on Fourier frequency analysis to estimate snow thermal properties. Among the formulae evaluated, we found that a modified force-restore formula, based on the superimposition of the force-restore equation capturing diurnal fluctuations on a gradually changing temperature gradient, had the best agreement with observations of heat conduction. This formula is suggested for the parameterization of snow surface temperature in a full snowpack energy balance model.}},

This paper derives an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) scattering model for dense media, such as snow, which takes into account multiple scattering effects through the Quasi‐Crystalline Approximation. The result of this derivation is a simplified version of the InSAR correlation model derived for relating the InSAR correlation measurements to the snowpack characteristics of grain size, volume fraction, and layer depth as well as those aspects of the volume‐ground interaction that affects the interferometric observation (i.e., the surface topography and the ratio of ground‐to‐volume scattering). Based on the model, the sensitivity of the InSAR correlation measurements to the snow characteristics is explored by simulation. Through this process, it is shown that Ka‐band InSAR phase has a good sensitivity to snow grain size and volume fraction, while for lower frequency signals (Ku‐band to L‐band), the InSAR correlation magnitude and phase have a sensitivity to snow depth. Since the formulation depends, in part, on the pair distribution function, three functional forms of the pair distribution function are implemented and their effects on InSAR phase measurements compared. The InSAR scattering model described in this paper is intended to be an observational prototype for future Ka‐band and L‐band InSAR missions, such as NASA's Surface Water and Ocean Topography and NASA‐ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar missions, planned for launch in the 2020–2021 time frame. This formulation also enables further investigation of the InSAR‐based snow retrieval approaches.

We indirectly characterized the variation in snow grain size using the daily profiles of the temperature gradient within the snowpack. In addition, a zoning and multitemporal modeling strategy was employed to reduce the bias and uncertainty caused by snow heterogeneity across different ecoregions and seasons. The proposed model was implemented to retrieve the global daily snow depth from 2001 to 2010.

SAR remote sensing-based techniques, such as interferometric SAR (InSAR) and Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) have already proven useful in the estimation of geophysical parameters of snow. InSAR-based techniques utilize interferometric phase information from repeat-pass datasets for snow parameters retrieval. During the monitoring of snow, the large temporal gap between the repeat passes results in the temporal decorrelation in the snowpack, which leads to the loss of interferometric coherence. Hence, there is a need for a technique for snow parameters estimation, which can work with zero temporal baseline datasets. This study works on the development of a Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (PolInSAR) based modelling approach for snow-depth estimation using TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X datasets acquired in the pursuit monostatic mode (temporal baseline = 10 seconds). The study area of this work is the Manali region of Himachal Pradesh situated in the Beas basin. Multi-temporal analysis of the snow-depth variation is executed utilizing the two pursuit-monostatic TanDEM-X interferometric quad-pol dataset pairs of the dates 21 January 2015 and 22 January 2015. In this study, the PolInSAR-based Coherence Amplitude Inversion modelling approach is used for the snow-depth retrieval. The magnitude of the complex interferometric coherence is used during the modelling implementation. The snow extinction coefficient is estimated and used as an input during PolInSAR modelling. Further, a comparison of the calculated volume coherence magnitude and the observed volume coherence magnitude is done during model implementation for the snow-depth estimation. The snow depth is estimated at a resolution of 15 m × 15 m in range and azimuth directions respectively. The estimated snow depth for both the dates shows a precise correlation with the ground datasets. The rise in model retrieved snow-depth value from 0.84 m to 1.24 m is observed during the period. The retrieved results were validated using the ground data of snow depth from the Automatic weather station (AWS) of Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE), Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), and Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS) installed in the Dhundi region of the study area for same dates.}},

In this paper, the characteristics of C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in an area of shallow dry snow cover were analyzed based on microwave backscattering models and field snow cover measurements. The analysis revealed that the backscattering of shallow dry snow cover was dominated by the scattering of the snow-ground interface, and the dielectric constant and roughness parameters of the underlying frozen soil were the primary factors that affected the total scattering. The dielectric constant of the soil depended on the amount of liquid water present in the soil, and the amount of liquid water was primarily determined by the soil temperature. Furthermore, the insulation properties (thermal resistance) of the snow cover affected the underlying soil temperature. Consequently, the snow cover characteristics affected the backscattering signal recorded by the SAR sensors. Based on an investigation involving ENVISAT-ASAR data and simultaneous ground-based snow observations conducted on 14 March 2008, we found that the snow temperature decreased with increasing snow depth when the snow depth was less than 20 cm, and the temperature increased with decreasing snow depth when the snow depth exceeded 20 cm. Additionally, the amount of liquid water in the underlying frozen soil rapidly increased with increasing temperature. To estimate the SWE, we used a small number of field measurements data and SAR ratio images to develop two equations. The first equation defined the relationship between the snow's thermal resistance and backscattering ratio, and the second equation yielded the SWE from the estimated thermal resistance of the snow-covered area. The root mean square and relative errors of the estimated SWE were approximately 7.41 mm and 6.17\%, respectively. The derived SWE also indicated that blowing snow and sun radiation were two primary factors that determined the spatial distribution of snow cover in mountainous areas.}},

abstract = {{As a fundamental physical property of snowpack, snow density is used to describe many essential features of snowpack behaviour. However, the variability in snow density across the Northern Hemisphere (NH) is largely unknown. Here, we investigate snow density variability in conjunction with snow classes and geographic elements in the NH based on 6,954 snow sites from 1909 to 2019. Precipitation, air temperature, and snowfall based on meteorological sites, as well as the aridity index (AI) and wind speed from reanalysis data, are also applied to describe the effect of climate on snow density. The results present that the long-term mean snow density is 246 ± 70 kg/m3 considering all in-situ measurement sites. Considerable spatial heterogeneity in snow density exists with contrasting snow densities among differing snow classes. The values range from 198 ± 79 kg/m3 for ephemeral snow to 363 ± 63 kg/m3 for maritime snow. For the seasonal evolution of snow density, the different snow classes share a general characteristic with the overall NH, a slight decrease from October to September, followed by a sustained increase. Moreover, the densification rate in the snow stable period varies over a much smaller range than that during the snowmelt period. Furthermore, the longitudinal trends in the variability of snow density are more pronounced compared to altitudinal and latitudinal trends. High snow densities are typically associated with adequate precipitation, warm air temperature, large aridity index, a long snow season, and heavy snowfall for different snow classes. The results will deepen the understanding of the snow density distribution at hemispherical scale, and provide basic data for the remote sensing of snow water equivalent and parameterization of snow models.}},

abstract = {{Canada's water cycle is driven mainly by snowmelt. Snow water equivalent (SWE) is the snow-related variable that is most commonly used in hydrology, as it expresses the total quantity of water (solid and liquid) stored in the snowpack. Measurements of SWE are, however, expensive and not continuously accessible in real time. This motivates a search for alternative ways of estimating SWE from measurements that are more widely available and continuous over time. SWE can be calculated by multiplying snow depth by the bulk density of the snowpack. Regression models proposed in the literature first estimate snow density and then calculate SWE. More recently, a novel approach to this problem has been developed and is based on an ensemble of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Although this approach compared favorably with existing regression models, snow density values at the lower and higher ends of the range remained inaccurate. Here, we improve upon this recent method for determining SWE from snow depth. We show the general applicability of the method through the use of a large data set of 234 779 snow depth–density–SWE records from 2878 nonuniformly distributed sites across Canada. These data cover almost 4 decades of snowfall. First, it is shown that the direct estimation of SWE produces better results than the estimation of snow density, followed by the calculation of SWE. Second, testing several artificial neural network (ANN) structural characteristics improves estimates of SWE. Optimizing MLP parameters separately for each snow climate class gives a greater representation of the geophysical diversity of snow. Furthermore, the uncertainty of snow depth measurements is included for a more realistic estimation. A comparison with commonly used regression models reveals that the ensemble of MLPs proposed here leads to noticeably more accurate estimates of SWE. This study thus shows that delving deeper into ANN theory helps improve SWE estimation.}},

Permanent scatterers (PSs) are helpful to overcome these problems, but their density in agricultural and out-of-town areas is not always sufficient. The forthcoming availability of satellite platforms with thinner orbital tubes and shorter revisit times will enhance the use of interferogram stacks, which are usable for distributed and progressively decorrelating targets, like those found in agricultural areas. To estimate the possibilities of the interferogram stack technique, a Markovian model for the temporal decorrelation is considered. ERS-1 data measured in C-band over Rome with a three-day repeat cycle are used to identify the parameters for this model, namely, the decorrelation time (estimated as 40 days) and the short-term coherence (estimated as 0.6). In the hypothesis of small deviations from a model of the motion, the optimal weights to be used to combine a sequence of interferograms taken at intervals that are shorter than the decorrelation time are calculated in the cases of progressive and sinusoidal ground motion. The dispersion of the optimal estimate of the motion is then determined. This model is extended to frequencies other than C-band. These evaluations are compared with the known results obtained for PSs. As an example, the case of a time interval between the takes of \$T = 12\textbackslash \textbackslashhbox\{days\}\$ is considered. With \$N\$ consecutive images, interferogram stack results are equivalent to PSs if the pixel count in the window used to smooth the interferograms grows with \$N\textasciicircum\{2\}\$.}},

abstract = {{Abstract. Area-based measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) are important for understanding earth system processes such as glacier mass balance, winter hydrological storage in drainage basins, and ground thermal regimes. Remote sensing techniques are ideally suited for wide-scale area-based mapping with the most commonly used technique to measure SWE being passive microwave, which is limited to coarse spatial resolutions of 25 km or greater and to areas without significant topographic variation. Passive microwave also has a negative bias for large SWE. Another method is repeat-pass synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) that allows measurement of SWE change at much higher spatial resolution. However, it has not been widely adopted because (1) the phase unwrapping problem has not been robustly addressed, especially for interferograms with poor coherence, and (2) SWE change maps scaled directly from repeat-pass interferograms are not an absolute measurement but contain unknown offsets for each contiguous coherent area. We develop and test a novel method for repeat-pass InSAR-based dry-snow SWE estimation that exploits the sensitivity of the dry-snow refraction-induced InSAR phase to topographic variations. The method robustly estimates absolute SWE change at spatial resolutions of < 1 km without the need for phase unwrapping. We derive a quantitative signal model for this new SWE change estimator and identify the relevant sources of bias. The method is demonstrated using both simulated SWE distributions and a 9-year RADARSAT-2 (C-band, 5.405 GHz) spotlight-mode dataset near Inuvik, Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. SWE results are compared to in situ snow survey measurements and estimates from ERA5 reanalysis. Our method performs well in high-relief areas, thus providing complementary coverage to passive-microwave-based SWE estimation. Further, our method has the advantage of requiring only a single wavelength band and thus can utilize existing spaceborne synthetic aperture radar systems.}},

Glacier and snowmelt from the high altitude Himalaya, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush mountain ranges are the largest drivers of discharge in the upper Indus Basin (UIB), and contribute significantly to Indus flows. Complex climatology and topography, coupled with the challenges of field study and meteorological measurement in these rugged ranges, elicit notable uncertainties in predicting seasonal runoff as well as cryospheric response to changes in climate. Here we utilize Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to track ablation season development of wet snow in the Shigar Watershed of the Karakoram Mountains in Pakistan from 2015 to 2018. We exploit opportune local image acquisition times to highlight diurnal differences in radar indications of wet snow, and examine the spatial and temporal contexts of radar diurnal differences for 2015, 2017, and 2018 ablation seasons. Radar classifications for each ablation season show spatial and temporal patterns that indicate a dry winter snowpack undergoing diurnal surface melt-refreeze cycles, transitioning to surface snow that remains wet both day and night, and finally snow free conditions following melt out. Diurnally differing SAR signals may offer insights into important snowpack energy balance processes that precede melt out, which could provide useful constraints for both glacier mass balance modeling and runoff forecasting in remote alpine watersheds.}},

The snow surface temperature is the result of the balance between external forcing (incoming radiation) and energy exchanges above the surface that depend on surface temperature (outgoing longwave radiation and turbulent fluxes) and the transport of energy into the snow by conduction and meltwater influx. Because of the strong insulating properties of snow, thermal gradients in snow packs are large and nonlinear, a fact that has led many to advocate multiple layer snowmelt models over single layer models. In an effort to keep snowmelt modeling simple and parsimonious, the Utah Energy Balance (UEB) snowmelt model used only one layer but allowed the snow surface temperature to be different from the snow average temperature by using an equilibrium gradient parameterization based on the surface energy balance. Although this procedure was considered an improvement over the ordinary single layer snowmelt models, it still resulted in discrepancies between modeled and measured snowpack energy contents. In this paper we evaluate the equilibrium gradient approach, the force-restore approach, and a modified force-restore approach when they are integrated as part of a complete energy and mass balance snowmelt model. The force-restore and modified force-restore approaches have not been incorporated into the UEB in early versions, even though Luce and Tartoton have done work in calculating the energy components using these approaches. In addition, we evaluate a scheme for representing the penetration of a refreezing front in cold periods following melt. We introduce a method to adjust effective conductivity to account for the presence of ground near to a shallow snow surface. These parameterizations were tested against data from the Central Sierra Snow Laboratory, CA, Utah State University experimental farm, UT, and subnivean snow laboratory at Niwot Ridge, CO. These tests compare modeled and measured snow surface temperature, snow energy content, snow water equivalent, and snowmelt outflow. We found that with these refinements the model is able to better represent the snowpack energy balance and internal energy content while still retaining a parsimonious one layer format.}},

Recently lidar has seen a dramatic widening of applications in the natural sciences, resulting in technological improvements and an increase in the availability of both airborne and ground-based sensors. Modern sensors allow mapping of vegetation heights and snow or ground surface elevations below forest canopies. Typical vertical accuracies for airborne datasets are decimeter-scale with order 1 m point spacings. Ground-based systems typically provide millimeter-scale range accuracy and sub-meter point spacing over 1 m to several kilometers. Many system parameters, such as scan angle, pulse rate and shot geometry relative to terrain gradients, require specification to achieve specific point coverage densities in forested and/or complex terrain. Additionally, snow has a significant volumetric scattering component, requiring different considerations for error estimation than for other Earth surface materials. We use published estimates of light penetration depth by wavelength to estimate radiative transfer error contributions. This paper presents a review of lidar mapping procedures and error sources, potential errors unique to snow surface remote sensing in the near-infrared and visible wavelengths, and recommendations for projects using lidar for snow-depth mapping.}},

To assess the improved correlation properties of L-band with respect to C-band, we analyzed L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) interferograms with a range of temporal and spatial baselines over three vegetated areas in California and compared them with corresponding C-band European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) interferograms. Over the highly vegetated Northern California forests in the Coast Range area, ALOS remains remarkably well correlated over a 2-year period, whereas an ERS interferogram with a similar temporal and spatial baseline lost correlation. In Central California near Parkfield, we found a similar pattern in decorrelation behavior, which enabled the recovery of a fault creep and a local uplifting signal at L-band that was not apparent at C-band. In the Imperial Valley in Southern California, both ALOS and ERS have low correlation over farmlands. ALOS has lower correlation over some sandy surfaces than ERS, probably due to low signal-to-noise ratio. In general, L-band interferograms with similar seasonal acquisitions have higher correlation than those with dissimilar season. For both L- and C-band, correlation over vegetated areas decreases with time for intervals less than 1 year and then remains relatively constant at longer time intervals. The decorrelation time for L-band is more than 2 years in the forest in California whereas that for C-band is less than 6 months. Overall, these results suggest that L-band interferograms will reveal near-fault interseismic deformation once sufficient data become available.}},

Unfortunately, most radars cannot measure t and site surveys are not accurate enough to determine r with the part-per-million accuracy required to obtain useful information about n. However, if the range to the target is fixed, but only known to a fair accuracy, say better than 1\%, it would be enough to allow us to relate changes in t to changes in n; the absolute calibration would then have to be done by other means.

This paper presents a theoretical and experimental study of snowpack sensing using radar interferometry. An approximate model of interferometric sensing based on the small perturbation method is proposed. As opposed to the well-known interferometric model, the proposed one takes into account microwave backscattering from the snow surface. We estimated the contribution of scattering from the snow surface to amplitude and interferometric phase values. Using Advanced Land Observing Satellite – 2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar – 2 (PALSAR-2), SWE was first determined by means of a radar interferometry method at a test site near Lake Baikal, Russia. The experiment consisted of comparing the phases of radar signals received when there was no snowpack (in September) and those in its presence (in February). We used a reference scatterer in the form of a trihedral corner reflector to calibrate the phase measurements. The SWE values were restored from the linear dependence between SWE and the interferometric phase. A comparison between the calculated and experimental data shows their good agreement.}},

Here we employ global sensitivity analysis to explore how (1) different error types (i.e., bias, random errors), (2) different error probability distributions, and (3) different error magnitudes influence physically based simulations of four snow variables (snow water equivalent, ablation rates, snow disappearance, and sublimation). We use the Sobol' global sensitivity analysis, which is typically used for model parameters but adapted here for testing model sensitivity to coexisting errors in all forcings. We quantify the Utah Energy Balance model's sensitivity to forcing errors with 1 840 000 Monte Carlo simulations across four sites and five different scenarios. Model outputs were (1) consistently more sensitive to forcing biases than random errors, (2) generally less sensitive to forcing error distributions, and (3) critically sensitive to different forcings depending on the relative magnitude of errors. For typical error magnitudes found in areas with drifting snow, precipitation bias was the most important factor for snow water equivalent, ablation rates, and snow disappearance timing, but other forcings had a more dominant impact when precipitation uncertainty was due solely to gauge undercatch. Additionally, the relative importance of forcing errors depended on the model output of interest. Sensitivity analysis can reveal which forcing error characteristics matter most for hydrologic modeling.}},

abstract = {{The key variable describing global seasonal snow cover is snow water equivalent (SWE). However, reliable information on the hemispheric scale variability of SWE is lacking because traditional methods such as interpolation of ground-based measurements and stand-alone algorithms applied to space-borne observations are highly uncertain with respect to the spatial distribution of snow mass and its evolution. In this paper, an algorithm assimilating synoptic weather station data on snow depth with satellite passive microwave radiometer data is applied to produce a 30-year-long time-series of seasonal SWE for the northern hemisphere. This data set is validated using independent SWE reference data from Russia, the former Soviet Union, Finland and Canada. The validation of SWE time-series indicates overall strong retrieval performance with root mean square errors below 40mm for cases when SWE <150mm. Retrieval uncertainty increases when SWE is above this threshold. The SWE estimates are also compared with results obtained by a typical stand-alone satellite passive microwave algorithm. This comparison demonstrates the benefits of the newly developed assimilation approach. Additionally, the trends and inter-annual variability of northern hemisphere snow mass during the era of satellite passive microwave measurements are shown.}},

Numerous processing approaches have been developed to improve InSAR results and overcome its limitations. Regardless of the processing methodology, however, temporal decorrelation is a major obstacle for all InSAR applications, especially over vegetated areas and dynamic environments, such as Interior Alaska. Temporal coherence is usually modeled as a univariate exponential function of temporal baseline. It has been, however, documented that temporal variations in surface backscattering due to the change in surface parameters, i.e., dielectric constant, roughness, and the geometry of scatterers, can result in gradual, seasonal, or sudden decorrelations and loss of InSAR coherence. The coherence models introduced so far have largely neglected the effect of the temporal change in backscattering on InSAR coherence. Here, we introduce a new temporal decorrelation model that considers changes in surface backscattering by utilizing the relative change in SAR intensity between two images as a proxy for the change in surface scattering parameters. The model also takes into account the decorrelation due to the change in snow depth between two images. Using the L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS-2) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR-2) data, the model has been assessed over forested and shrub landscapes in Delta Junction, Interior Alaska. The model decreases the RMS error of temporal coherence estimation from 0.18 to 0.09 on average. The improvements made by the model have been statistically proved to be significant at the 99\% confidence level. Additionally, the model shows that the coherence of forested areas are more prone to changes in backscattering than shrub landscape. The model is based on L-band data and may not be expanded to C-band or X-band InSAR observations.}},

abstract = {{Seasonal snow cover is the largest single component of the cryosphere in areal extent, covering an average of 46×106 km2 of Earth's surface (31 \% of the land area) each year, and is thus an important expression and driver of the Earth's climate. In recent years, Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has been declining at about the same rate (∼ -13 \% per decade) as Arctic summer sea ice. More than one-sixth of the world's population relies on seasonal snowpack and glaciers for a water supply that is likely to decrease this century. Snow is also a critical component of Earth's cold regions' ecosystems, in which wildlife, vegetation, and snow are strongly interconnected. Snow water equivalent (SWE) describes the quantity of water stored as snow on the land surface and is of fundamental importance to water, energy, and geochemical cycles. Quality global SWE estimates are lacking. Given the vast seasonal extent combined with the spatially variable nature of snow distribution at regional and local scales, surface observations are not able to provide sufficient SWE information. Satellite observations presently cannot provide SWE information at the spatial and temporal resolutions required to address science and high-socio-economic-value applications such as water resource management and streamflow forecasting. In this paper, we review the potential contribution of X- and Ku-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for global monitoring of SWE. SAR can image the surface during both day and night regardless of cloud cover, allowing high-frequency revisit at high spatial resolution as demonstrated by missions such as Sentinel-1. The physical basis for estimating SWE from X- and Ku-band radar measurements at local scales is volume scattering by millimeter-scale snow grains. Inference of global snow properties from SAR requires an interdisciplinary approach based on field observations of snow microstructure, physical snow modeling, electromagnetic theory, and retrieval strategies over a range of scales. New field measurement capabilities have enabled significant advances in understanding snow microstructure such as grain size, density, and layering. We describe radar interactions with snow-covered landscapes, the small but rapidly growing number of field datasets used to evaluate retrieval algorithms, the characterization of snowpack properties using radar measurements, and the refinement of retrieval algorithms via synergy with other microwave remote sensing approaches. This review serves to inform the broader snow research, monitoring, and application communities on progress made in recent decades and sets the stage for a new era in SWE remote sensing from SAR measurements.}},

abstract = {{Radar instruments have been widely used to measure snow water equivalent (SWE) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar is a promising approach for doing so from spaceborne platforms. Electromagnetic waves propagate through the snowpack at a velocity determined by its dielectric permittivity. Velocity estimates are a significant source of uncertainty in radar SWE retrievals, especially in wet snow. In dry snow, velocity can be calculated from relations between permittivity and snow density. However, wet snow velocity is a function of both snow density and liquid water content (LWC); the latter exhibits high spatiotemporal variability, there is no standard observation method, and it is not typically measured by automated stations. In this study, we used ground-penetrating radar (GPR), probed snow depths, and measured in situ vertically-averaged density to estimate SWE and bulk LWC for seven survey dates at Cameron Pass, Colorado (\textbackslashtextasciitilde3120 m) from April to June 2019. During this cooler than average season, median LWC for individual survey dates never exceeded 7 vol. \%. However, in June, LWC values greater than 10 vol. \% were observed in isolated areas where the ground and the base of the snowpack were saturated and therefore inhibited further meltwater output. LWC development was modulated by canopy cover and meltwater drainage was influenced by ground slope. We generated synthetic SWE retrievals that resemble the planned footprint of the NASA-ISRO L-band InSAR satellite (NISAR) from GPR using a dry snow density model. Synthetic SWE retrievals overestimated observed SWE by as much as 40\% during the melt season due to the presence of LWC. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering LWC variability in order to fully realize the potential of future spaceborne radar missions for measuring SWE.}},

A multitemporal (three winters) SAR data set was obtained using the Convair-580 from the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS) over a watershed in the Appalachian Mountains in Southern Quebec, Canada. The SAR data were relatively calibrated using extended targets (coniferous stands). Extensive ground measurements were done simultaneously to each of the seven flights, in order to measure the snow cover characteristics (depth, density, SWE, liquid water content, temperature, and dielectric profiles) as well as the soil characteristics (moisture, temperature). To estimate the SWE of a given snowpack, a model which links the scattering coefficient to the physical parameters of the snow cover and the underlying soil has been developed. The model is based on the ratio of the scattering coefficient of a field covered by snow to the scattering coefficient of a field without snow. The analysis has revealed that volume scattering from a shallow dry snow cover (SWE<20 cm) is undetectable. The backscattering power is dominated by soil surface scattering, the latter varying with the decrease of liquid water content in the surface layer with decreasing soil temperature below 0/spl deg/C. Then, the scattering ratio decreases proportionally to the dielectric constant of the soil in winter. Furthermore, a unique relationship for three acquisition dates has been found between the thermal resistance, R, of the snow pack and the backscattering power ratio. Then, the spatial distribution of the power ratio should depict the spatial distribution of R, given spatially uniform climatological conditions over the study area. Since linear relationships between SWE and R have been observed, it should be possible to estimate the SWE of shallow dry snow cover with C-band SAR data using few ground truthing data in an open area when the soil is frozen.}},

A multilayer-snow electromagnetic (EM) backscattering model is developed based on the vector radiative transfer, the strong fluctuation theory, and physical parameters supplied by the meteorological model. However, the limited resolution of the meteorological snow model is insufficient for predicting a refined EM backscattering at a massif scale. An adequate spatial reorganization of these snow profiles, based on a comparison between simulated and measured dual-polarization SAR data, leads to a better estimation of some snowpack parameters. In particular, the monitoring of snow liquid water content is presented improving the capacity of wet snow mapping as compared to a classical SAR-based method. This methodology shows good capacities both for qualitative and quantitative snow assessments, opening the way for a new operational method.}},

This data dependence is increasingly challenged, with global and regional climatological factors changing the seasonal snowpack dynamics in mountain watersheds. To evaluate and improve the CBRFC modeling options, this work ran the physically based snow energy balance iSnobal model, forced with outputs from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) numerical weather prediction model across 4 years in a Colorado River Basin forecast region. Compared to in situ, remotely sensed, and the current operational CBRFC model data, the HRRR-iSnobal combination showed well-reconstructed snow depth patterns and magnitudes until peak accumulation. Once snowmelt set in, HRRR-iSnobal showed slower simulated snowmelt relative to observations, depleting snow on average up to 34 d later. The melting period is a critical component for water forecasting. Based on the results, there is a need for revised forcing data input preparation (shortwave radiation) required by iSnobal, which is a recommended future improvement to the model. Nevertheless, the presented performance and architecture make HRRR-iSnobal a promising combination for the CBRFC production needs, where there is a demonstrated change to the seasonal snow in the mountain ranges around the Colorado River Basin. The long-term goal is to introduce the HRRR-iSnobal combination in day-to-day CBRFC operations, and this work created the foundation to expand and evaluate larger CBRFC domains.}},

The barrier is compared with “rosette” spatial filters and with a reference site that uses no noise reduction system. The barrier is investigated for use at International Monitoring System (IMS) infrasound array sites where spatially extensive noise-reducing systems cannot be used because of a shortage of suitable land. Wind speed inside a 2-m-high 50\%-porous hexagonal barrier coated with a fine wire mesh is reduced from ambient levels by 90\%. If the infrasound wind-noise level reductions are all plotted versus the reduced frequency given by f*L/ν, where L is the characteristic size of the array or barrier, f is the frequency, and ν is the wind speed, the reductions at different wind speeds are observed to collapse into a single curve for each wind-noise reduction method. The reductions are minimal below a reduced frequency of 0.3 to 1, depending on the device, then spatial averaging over the turbulence structure leads to increased reduction. Above the reduced corner frequency, the barrier reduces infrasonic noise by up to 20 to 25 dB. Below the corner frequency the barrier displays a small reduction of about 4 dB. The rosettes display no reduction below the corner frequency. One other advantage of the wind barrier over rosette spatial filters is that the signal recorded inside the barrier enters the microbarometer from free air and is not integrated, possibly out of phase, after propagation through a system of narrow pipes.}},

In other natural, heterogeneous materials monitoring AE has proven to be a valuable tool for stability estimation and failure prediction. After studying the characteristics of ultrasonic wave propagation in snow, we measured the acoustic emission signals during snow loading experiments in a cold laboratory. Using snow columns we found that most energy of an artificial acoustic signal was transmitted at 31kHz. Best coupling to snow was achieved by attaching the AE sensors with silicone adhesive to thin aluminium plates which were then frozen to the snow. Localizing AE events during fracture of layered snow samples showed that the AE originated within the weakest layer, i.e. the relevant layer for snow failure. For finding an indication of imminent failure, we analysed the exponent β of the cumulative size-frequency distribution (‘survival curve’) of event energy. At the occurrence of instabilities, the β-curve deviated from steady behaviour and exhibited distinct ‘drops’, indicating that the power law behaviour of the distribution was not fulfilled anymore. Studying the temporal evolution of the exponent β might therefore provide useful information about snowpack stability also in the field—provided that the AE signals are not too strongly attenuated and can be detected in time before catastrophic failure occurs.}},

This effort involves the recovery of land surface, ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft, satellite, and other data; quality controlling and assimilating these data with a data assimilation system that is kept unchanged over the reanalysis period 1957–96. This eliminates perceived climate jumps associated with changes in the data assimilation system. The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data assimilation system and a database as complete as possible. The data assimilation and the model used are identical to the global system implemented operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210 km). The database has been enhanced with many sources of observations not available in real time for operations, provided by different countries and organizations. The system has been designed with advanced quality control and monitoring components, and can produce 1 mon of reanalysis per day on a Cray YMP/8 supercomputer. Different types of output archives are being created to satisfy different user needs, including a “quick look” CD-ROM (one per year) with six tropospheric and stratospheric fields available twice daily, as well as surface, top-of-the-atmosphere, and isentropic fields. Reanalysis information and selected output is also available on-line via the Internet (http//:nic.fb4.noaa.gov:8000). A special CD-ROM, containing 13 years of selected observed, daily, monthly, and climatological data from the NCEP/NCAR Re-analysis, is included with this issue. Output variables are classified into four classes, depending on the degree to which they are influenced by the observations and/or the model. For example, “C” variables (such as precipitation and surface fluxes) are completely determined by the model during the data assimilation and should be used with caution. Nevertheless, a comparison of these variables with observations and with several climatologies shows that they generally contain considerable useful information. Eight-day forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful for predictability studies and for monitoring the quality of the observing systems. The 40 years of reanalysis (1957–96) should be completed in early 1997. A continuation into the future through an identical Climate Data Assimilation System will allow researchers to reliably compare recent anomalies with those in earlier decades. Since changes in the observing systems will inevitably produce perceived changes in the climate, parallel reanalyses (at least 1 year long) will be generated for the periods immediately after the introduction of new observing systems, such as new types of satellite data. NCEP plans currently call for an updated reanalysis using a state-of-the-art system every five years or so. The successive reanalyses will be greatly facilitated by the generation of the comprehensive database in the present reanalysis.}},

We investigate the ability of the Sentinel-1 mission to monitor snow depth at sub-kilometer (100 m, 500 m, and 1 km) resolutions over the European Alps for 2017–2019. The Sentinel-1 backscatter observations, especially in cross-polarization, show a high correlation with regional model simulations of snow depth over Austria and Switzerland. The observed changes in radar backscatter with the accumulation or ablation of snow are used in an empirical change detection algorithm to retrieve snow depth. The algorithm includes the detection of dry and wet snow conditions. Compared to in situ measurements at 743 sites in the European Alps, dry snow depth retrievals at 500 m and 1 km resolution have a spatio-temporal correlation of 0.89. The mean absolute error equals 20 \%–30 \% of the measured values for snow depths between 1.5 and 3 m. The performance slightly degrades for retrievals at the finer 100 m spatial resolution as well as for retrievals of shallower and deeper snow. The results demonstrate the ability of Sentinel-1 to provide snow estimates in mountainous regions where satellite-based estimates of snow mass are currently lacking. The retrievals can improve our knowledge of seasonal snow mass in areas with complex topography and benefit a number of applications, such as water resource management, flood forecasting, and numerical weather prediction. However, future research is recommended to further investigate the physical basis of the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 backscatter observations to snow accumulation.}},

Given the fragile nature of freshly fallen snow, non-contact, non-destructive characterization methods made possible via acoustic signals, are desirable. High frequency wave propagation methods can be used to determine in-situ, near-surface, micro-pore geometry parameters in snow using methods demonstrated on cohesive porous materials, including manufactured foams, porous metals, and sintered glass beads. High frequency (90 kHz), oblique-angle and near vertical reflection measurements were conducted on snow samples in a cold room to demonstrate the feasibility of acoustic characterization. A nonlinear least squares regression to the theoretical reflection response was used to derive the best-fitting values for the porosity and tortuosity. We compared the acoustically-derived snow physical parameters, including porosity and tortuosity, with values determined from X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT) for different snow types. The μCT-measured and acoustically-derived methods demonstrated strong agreement for porosity with differences averaging 8\% for all samples. Tortuosity values, however, had average differences of roughly 20\% for all samples. The different error rates might be caused by the stronger dependence of the acoustic reflection on porosity than on tortuosity. For both parameters, the small grain snow and large grain firn samples had errors much larger than the fresh or 1 day samples. Fresh snow has the lowest reflection coefficients and demonstrates a steady decrease from <0.1 at normal incidence as the angle increases. Aging fresh snow for 1 day caused detectable changes in acoustic response, from slight decreases in porosity, and slight increases in tortuosity that occurred from sintering.}},

To address this gap, we propose datasheets for datasets. In the electronics industry, every component, no matter how simple or complex, is accompanied with a datasheet that describes its operating characteristics, test results, recommended uses, and other information. By analogy, we propose that every dataset be accompanied with a datasheet that documents its motivation, composition, collection process, recommended uses, and so on. Datasheets for datasets will facilitate better communication between dataset creators and dataset consumers, and encourage the machine learning community to prioritize transparency and accountability.}}

abstract = {{The presence of seasonal snow cover during the cold season of the annual air temperature cycle has significant influence on the ground thermal regime in cold regions. Snow has high albedo and emissivity that cool the snow surface, high absorptivity that tends to warm the snow surface, low thermal conductivity so that a snow layer acts as an insulator, and high latent heat due to snowmelt that is a heat sink. The overall impact of snow cover on the ground thermal regime depends on the timing, duration, accumulation, and melting processes of seasonal snow cover; density, structure, and thickness of seasonal snow cover; and interactions of snow cover with micrometeorological conditions, local microrelief, vegetation, and the geographical locations. Over different timescales either the cooling or warming impact of seasonal snow cover may dominate. In the continuous permafrost regions, impact of seasonal snow cover can result in an increase of the mean annual ground and permafrost surface temperature by several degrees, whereas in discontinuous and sporadic permafrost regions the absence of seasonal snow cover may be a key factor for permafrost development. In seasonally frozen ground regions, snow cover can substantially reduce the seasonal freezing depth. However, the influence of seasonal snow cover on seasonally frozen ground has received relatively little attention, and further study is needed. Ground surface temperatures, reconstructed from deep borehole temperature gradients, have increased by up to 4°C in the past centuries and have been widely used as evidence of paleoclimate change. However, changes in air temperature alone cannot account for the changes in ground temperatures. Changes in seasonal snow conditions might have significantly contributed to the ground surface temperature increase. The influence of seasonal snow cover on soil temperature, soil freezing and thawing processes, and permafrost has considerable impact on carbon exchange between the atmosphere and the ground and on the hydrological cycle in cold regions/cold seasons.}},

In the parallel algorithm, the model domain is split into smaller rectangular sub-domains that are distributed over multiple processor cores using one-dimensional decomposition. All of the memory allocations from the original code have been reduced to the size of the local sub-domains, allowing each core to perform fewer computations and requiring less memory for each process. A majority of the subroutines in SnowModel were simple to parallelize; however, there were certain physical processes, including blowing snow redistribution and components within the solar radiation and wind models, that required non-trivial parallelization using halo-exchange patterns. To validate the parallel algorithm and assess parallel scaling characteristics, high-resolution (100 m grid) simulations were performed over several western United States domains and over the contiguous United States (CONUS). The CONUS scaling experiment had approximately 71 \% parallel efficiency; runtime decreased by a factor of 32 running on 2304 cores relative to 52 cores (the minimum number of cores that could be used to run such a large domain as a result of memory and time limitations).

Snow cover extent monitoring has been one such application where microwave sensors have been a popular choice due to their sensitivity toward the dielectric property. Snow is a dynamic matter since its dielectric state is dependent on climatic factors prevailing locally around it. In the literature, the polarization fraction (PF) has been used for landcover characterization. In this paper, we utilize the seasonal variation of the PF for mapping snow cover over the Himalayan terrain. Temporal variation of the strength in the polarized return due to change in landcover and season is the prime motivation behind this approach. In addition, the effect of SAR data acquisition time on mapping algorithms is considered in this work which is seldom discussed in the literature. Furthermore, a study is conducted to analyze the seasonal variation in the entropy (\$H\$) and the scattering type ( \$\textbackslashalpha\$) parameters over the bare snow-covered ground and the forested areas. The seasonal response of the terrain in the \$H/\textbackslashalpha\$ plane corresponding to specific scattering characteristics is analyzed. The applicability of the approach is tested with RADARSAT-2 (FQ28) C-band full polarimetric image pairs over the ManaliDhundi region, Himachal Pradesh, India, located in the western Hindu-Kush Himalayas.

Despite its importance, this information is incomplete today and only available for limited areas and limited time periods. Manual avalanche mapping from satellite imagery has recently been applied to reduce this gap achieving promising results. However, their reliability and completeness were not yet verified satisfactorily.  In our study we attempt a full validation of the completeness of visually detected and mapped avalanches from optical SPOT-6, Sentinel-2 and radar Sentinel-1 imagery. We examine manually mapped avalanches from two avalanche periods in 2018 and 2019 for an area of approximately 180 km2 around Davos, Switzerland relying on ground- and helicopter-based photographs as ground truth. For the quality assessment, we investigate the Probability of Detection (POD) and the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). Additionally, we relate our results to conditions which potentially influence avalanche detection in the satellite imagery.  We statistically confirm the high potential of SPOT for comprehensive avalanche mapping for selected periods (POD = 0.74, PPV = 0.88) as well as the reliability of Sentinel-1 for the mapping of larger avalanches (POD = 0.27, PPV = 0.87). Furthermore, we proof that Sentinel-2 is unsuitable for the mapping of most avalanches due to its spatial resolution (POD = 0.06, PPV = 0.81). Because we could apply the same reference avalanche events for all three satellite mappings, our validation results are robust and comparable. We demonstrate that satellite-based avalanche mapping has the potential to fill the existing avalanche documentation gap over large areas, making alpine regions safer.}},

A modified version of the snow cover model SNOWPACK is used to successfully reproduce the artificially compacted and the additionally covered snow cover in a physically based way. Supplementary measurements of crucial material properties of the 4.5mm thin geotextile serve as model input as well. Results indicate that the shortwave reflectivity of the covers is responsible for 46\% of the performance. Thermal insulation of the material (14\%) and a negative latent heat flux due to evaporation of precipitation from the cover surface (10\%) have almost the same contribution. A layer of air between the cover and the snow and ice surface (thickness 7.5cm to 12cm) adds the rest, which is at the upper limit of observations and may therefore also compensate for model errors. This generally explains the high performance of the method in glacier ski resorts and, most importantly, an altitude dependent application limit of the method: the method becomes less effective at lower altitudes, where sensible heat fluxes become more important compared to shortwave radiation.}},

Producing robust estimates of tropospheric delays remains one of the key challenges in increasing the accuracy of ground deformation measurements using InSAR. Recent studies revealed the efficiency of global atmospheric reanalysis to mitigate the impact of tropospheric delays, motivating further exploration of their potential. Here we explore the effectiveness of these models in several geographic and tectonic settings on both single interferograms and time series analysis products. Both hydrostatic and wet contributions to the phase delay are important to account for. We validate these path delay corrections by comparing with estimates of vertically integrated atmospheric water vapor content derived from the passive multispectral imager Medium‐Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, onboard the Envisat satellite. Generally, the performance of the prediction depends on the vigor of atmospheric turbulence. We discuss (1) how separating atmospheric and orbital contributions allows one to better measure long‐wavelength deformation and (2) how atmospheric delays affect measurements of surface deformation following earthquakes, and (3) how such a method allows us to reduce biases in multiyear strain rate estimates by reducing the influence of unevenly sampled seasonal oscillations of the tropospheric delay. We validate the prediction of atmospheric phase screen against independent data We explore the effectiveness of such method on single interferograms Such method improves time series reconstruction and velocity map estimation}},

abstract = {{Oil and gas activities on Alaska's North Slope overlap spatially with polar bear (Ursus maritimus) maternal denning habitat and temporally with the peri‐partum and emergence periods. Noise associated with these activities can be substantial and concerns regarding the effects on polar bears have been acknowledged. But the secluded and ephemeral nature of subnivean maternal dens renders the measurement of behavioral and physiological responses of bears to noise exposure challenging, except for rare cases when disturbance‐prompted den abandonment has been documented. These limitations, coupled with the uncertainty associated with the synergistic effects of anthropogenic activities on bears in a rapidly changing Arctic, prompt the need to develop predictive models of disturbance to ensure management guidelines effectively mitigate disturbance. Towards this end, we characterized noise propagation from 9 sources (2 aircraft, 2 over‐tundra tracked vehicles, 4 wheeled on‐road vehicles, and humans walking) used to support industrial activities around artificial snow dens near Milne Point, Alaska, USA, in March–April 2010. We built dens in 4 configurations to mimic variability in den roof thickness and to evaluate differences in noise propagation from when the den was closed compared to being open, similar to den emergence. We integrated these data with an existing polar bear audiogram and developed models to predict auditory‐detection probabilities as a function of distance from the den. Within a closed den, aircraft had high probabilities (detection probability ≥75\%) of being detected by polar bears at distances ≤1.6 km and ground‐based sources had high probabilities of detection at distances ≤0.8 km. On average, closed dens reduced noise levels by 15 decibels (dB) relative to open dens. Our findings indicate that although polar bear snow dens effectively attenuate acoustic sound pressure levels, noise from some industrial support vehicles was likely to be detected farther from dens than previously documented. These results reinforce the importance of maintaining buffer zones around polar bear dens to minimize the potential for den disturbance. © 2020 The Wildlife Society. We report a relatively high (≥0.75) probability that polar bears in dens can hear industrial support vehicles (especially aircraft) from ≤1.6 km away. Our findings support the use of 1.6‐km exclusion zones around known polar bear den sites in Alaska, USA.}},

Other features supported by the antenna include elevation monopulse and pulse-to-pulse re-steering capabilities that will enable some novel modes of operation.

In SNOWPACK, the complex texture of snow is described using the four primary microstructure parameters: grain size, bond size, dendricity and sphericity. For each parameter, rate equations are developed that predict the development in time as a function of the environmental conditions. The rate equations are based on theoretical considerations such as mixture theory and on empirical relations. With a classification scheme, the conventional snow grain types are predicted on the basis of those parameters. The approach to link the bulk constitutive properties, viscosity and thermal conductivity to microstructure parameters is novel to the field of snow cover modeling. Expanding on existing knowledge on microstructure-based viscosity and thermal conductivity, a complete description of those quantities applicable to the seasonal snow cover is presented. This includes the strong coupling between physical processes in snow: The bond size, which changes not only through metamorphic processes but also through the process of pressure sintering (included in our viscosity formulation), is at the same time the single most important parameter for snow viscosity and thermal conductivity. Laboratory results are used to illustrate the performance of the formulations presented. The numerical implementation is treated in the companion paper Part I.

ALS generally had greater but similar snow depth values to TLS, and results were not sensitive to the gridded cell size between 0.5 and 5 m. The greatest disagreements were where snow‐off TLS scans had shrubs and high incidence angles, leading to deeper snow depths (>10 cm) from ALS than TLS. The low vegetation and oblique angles caused occlusion in the TLS data and thus produced higher snow‐off bare Earth models relative to the ALS. Furthermore, in subcanopy areas where both ALS and TLS data existed, snow depth differences were comparable to differences in the open. Meanwhile, median values from 52 snow‐probe transects and near‐coincident ALS data had a mean difference of 6 cm, root‐mean‐square difference of 8 cm, mean‐absolute difference of 7 cm, and a mean difference in the standard deviation of 1 cm. Snow depth probes had greater but similar snow depth values to ALS. Therefore, based on comparisons with TLS and snow depth probes, ALS captured snow depth magnitude with better than or equal agreement to what has been reported in previous studies and showed the ability to capture high‐resolution spatial variability.

Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2016: a streamlined process for assembling and preprocessing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2016 production. The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty World Reference System-2 path/row throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall agreement ranging from 71\% to 97\% between land cover classification and reference data was achieved for all tested area and all years. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2016 operational mapping.}},

In general, Δx ⪡ X (the depth of interest) and Δt ⪡P (period or duration of the surface temperature changes). The usual numerical expression for D was extended to include higher order terms and an analytical expression was derived for D when unfrozen water is present in frozen soils and permafrost.

Particularly in wetland research, TerraSAR-X’s shortwave X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) possesses unique capabilities, such as high spatial and temporal resolution, for delineating and characterizing the inherent spatially and temporally complex and heterogeneous structure of wetland ecosystems and their dynamics. As transitional areas, wetlands comprise characteristics of both terrestrial and aquatic features, forming a large diversity of wetland types. This study reviews all published articles incorporating TerraSAR-X information into wetland research to provide a comprehensive study of how this sensor has been used with regard to polarization, and the function of the data, time-series analyses, or the assessment of specific wetland ecosystem types. What is evident throughout this literature review is the synergistic fusion of multi-frequency and multi-polarization SAR sensors, sometimes optical sensors, in almost all investigated studies to attain improved wetland classification results. Due to the short revisiting time of the TerraSAR-X sensor, it is possible to compute dense SAR time-series, allowing for a more precise observation of the seasonality in dynamic wetland areas as demonstrated in many of the reviewed studies.}},

For the radiometric calibration, we employ an array of trihedral corner reflectors, as well as distributed targets. We show that UAVSAR is a well-calibrated SAR system for polarimetric applications, with absolute radiometric calibration bias better than 1 dB, residual root-mean-square (RMS) errors of ∼0.7 dB, and RMS phase errors ∼5.3°. For the polarimetric calibration, we have evaluated the methods of Quegan and Ainsworth et al. for crosstalk calibration and find that the method of Quegan gives crosstalk estimates that depend on target type, whereas the method of Ainsworth et al. gives more stable crosstalk estimates.

One test involved transmission of acoustic signals in the frequency range 100-20 000 Hz through natural snow-pack in order to measure signal loss of a point acoustic source. At all frequencies the relatively high-energy input signal decays rapidly by energy dissipation, with nominal diffusion occurring at large distances from the source. Signal persistence is greatest in the frequency range 100-200 Hz, In a second test, acoustic bursts in snow columns under deformation were recorded. Spectrum analysis in the frequency range 500-14000 Hz reveals dominance of signal amplitudes at frequencies between 1 000 and 10 000 Hz. This dominance is attributed to the strong attenuation properties of snow and suggests the use of waveguide or collector techniques to monitor natural acoustic emissions in snow-pack. In a third test several waveguide geometries and materials were evaluated for their acoustic signal interception and transmission characteristics. In general, metallic waveguides show the least attenuation of the configurations tested.}},

Declining trends are observed across all months, states, and climates, but are largest in spring, in the Pacific states, and in locations with mild winter climate. We corroborate and extend these observations using a gridded hydrology model, which also allows a robust estimate of total western snowpack and its decline. We find a large increase in the fraction of locations that posted decreasing trends, and averaged across the western US, the decline in average April 1 snow water equivalent since mid-century is roughly 15–30\% or 25–50 km3, comparable in volume to the West’s largest man-made reservoir, Lake Mead. Mountain snowpack stores huge amounts of water in the western US, supplying much of the water used to grow crops. A team of researchers from Oregon State University and UCLA found that spring snowpack declined almost everywhere, especially in the coastal states and other locations with mild winter climate. (Skiers will be relieved that declines were smaller in winter.) Not surprisingly, the declines are mostly related to warming climate. Using a physically-based model of the hydrologic cycle, which takes daily weather as inputs and computes snow accumulation and melt, runoff, etc., the researchers computed the total snowpack in the western US. Total snowpack declined 15–30\%, and the amount of that lost water is comparable in volume to the West’s largest man-made reservoir, Lake Mead. Many water managers are already planning for a future with less snow, but this research emphasizes that the future is here.}},

First, the setup and the mode of operation of the scatterometers are discussed. Both instruments measure the backscattering coefficients /spl gamma/ at hh, /spl nu//spl nu/, /spl nu/h, and /spl nu/h polarizations and for incidence angles ranging from 0 to 70/spl deg/. The accuracy of /spl gamma/ is generally better than /spl plusmn/1.8 dB, and the scatterometers are well suited for signature studies of natural surfaces. During the two years, the authors performed many backscattering measurements of natural, strongly layered snowcovers and the authors investigated relationships between /spl gamma/ and physical parameters of the snowcover. All measurements were collected in a signature catalogue. They report on results at 40/spl deg/ incidence angle. They found that the combined use of active sensors at 5.3 and 35 GHz allows the discrimination of various snowcover situations, if multitemporal information is available. In addition, they observed a relationship of /spl gamma/ at 5.3 GHz with the integrated column height of liquid water and dependencies of /spl gamma/ at 35 GHz on the height of the dry snow, on the volumetric liquid water content at the snow surface, and on the thickness of the refrozen crust at the snow surface.}},

Due to refraction, the interferometric phase changes with snow depth and density, which is exploited by the InSAR method. While the method was first proposed two decades ago, qualitative research using experimental data analyzing factors affecting retrieval performance remains scarce. In this work, a tower-based 1–10-GHz, fully polarimetric SAR with InSAR capabilities was used to analyze the effect of meteorological events (air temperature, precipitation intensity, and wind) on the observed temporal decorrelation of interferometric image pairs at L-, S-, C-, and X-bands. These factors were found to be causes of decorrelation in snow, being the temperature the critical variable in the case of snowmelt events. Of the analyzed bands, the L-band presented the best coherence conservation properties. In addition, the phase change between pairs with sufficient coherence was applied to generate estimates of changes in SWE, studying the retrieval errors at different bands and over different temporal baselines. SWE accumulation was calculated from 6 h up to 12 days’ temporal baseline over a nonvegetated area. SWE accumulation profiles were successfully reconstructed for short temporal baselines and low frequencies, while an increase in the retrieval error was observed for high frequencies and long temporal baselines, indicating the limitations of higher frequencies for repeat-pass InSAR retrieval. The analysis was also reproduced over a forested area at the L-band with similar results as to the nonvegetated area.}},

Gaps in elastic wave propagation characteristics in snow hinder quantitative interpretation of AE signals. Our study focuses on characterizing the propagation of acoustic reference signals in the ultrasonic range across cylindrical snow samples with varying density (240–450kgm−3). We deduced the acoustic attenuation coefficient within snow by performing experiments with different column lengths to eliminate possible influences of the snow-sensor coupling. The attenuation coefficient was measured for the entire burst signal and for single frequency components in the range of 8 to 35kHz. The acoustic wave propagation speed, calculated from the travel time of the acoustic signal, varied between 300ms−1 and 950ms−1, depending on the density and hardness of snow. From the sound speed we also estimated the Young's modulus of our snow samples; the values of the modulus ranged from 30 to 340MPa for densities between 240 and 450kgm−3. In addition, we modeled the sound propagation for our experimental setup using Biot's model for wave propagation in a porous medium. The model results were in good agreement with our experimental results and suggest that our acoustic signals consisted of Biot's slow and fast waves. Our results can be used to improve the identification and localization of acoustic emission sources within snow in view of assessing snow slope instability.}},

Rather than developing hybrid processing chains where two or more algorithms are applied to the same data-stack, and results are then combined, in this paper we introduce a new approach, SqueeSAR, to jointly process PS and DS, taking into account their different statistical behavior. As it will be shown, PS and DS can be jointly processed without the need for significant changes to the traditional PSInSAR processing chain and without the need to unwrap hundreds of interferograms, provided that the coherence matrix associated with each DS is properly “squeezed” to provide a vector of optimum (wrapped) phase values.

The microwave satellite data are based on temporal variations in the differences of the brightness temperature from satellite passive microwave radiometers. The analysis shows that the microwave‐based method detects melt onset on average 10 days later than the albedo‐based method, which results from the different melt detection methods; the albedo‐based method observes the point when the spring snow metamorphism begins to have a detectable effect on snow albedo, whereas the microwave‐based method detects the appearance of meltwater in snowpack. The difference in MOD decreases in forests, because canopy protects snow from sunlight delaying snow metamorphism. Additionally, we analyzed the MOD estimates for trends across the Northern Hemisphere and separately for Eurasia and North America. A statistically significant negative trend toward earlier melt onset exists in all cases, which is consistent with previous studies.

The distribution of liquid water in snow is commonly estimated from point measurements using a "hand" squeeze test, or a dielectric device such as a "Snow Fork" or a "Denoth meter". Here we compare estimates of water content in the Swiss Alps made using the hand test to those made with a Snow Fork and a Denoth meter. Measurements were conducted in the Swiss Alps, mostly above tree line; more than 12 000 measurements were made at 85 locations over 30 days. Results show that the hand test generally over estimates the volumetric liquid water content. Estimates using the Snow Fork are generally 1 \% higher than those derived from the Denoth meter. The measurements were also used to investigate temporal and small-scale spatial patterns of wetness. Results show that typically a single point measurement does not characterize the wetness of the surrounding snow. Large diurnal changes in wetness are common in the near-surface snow, and associated changes at depth were also observed. A single vertical profile of measurements is not sufficient to determine whether these changes were a result of a spatially homogeneous wetting front or caused by infiltration through pipes. Based on our observations, we suggest that three measurements at horizontal distances greater than 50 cm are needed to adequately characterize the distribution of liquid water through a snowpack. Further, we suggest a simplified classification scheme that includes five wetness patterns that incorporate both the vertical and horizontal distribution of liquid water in a snowpack.}},

abstract = {{SnowModel is a spatially distributed snow-evolution modeling system designed for application in landscapes, climates, and conditions where snow occurs. It is an aggregation of four submodels: MicroMet defines meteorological forcing conditions, EnBal calculates surface energy exchanges, SnowPack simulates snow depth and water-equivalent evolution, and SnowTran-3D accounts for snow redistribution by wind. Since each of these submodels was originally developed and tested for nonforested conditions, details describing modifications made to the submodels for forested areas are provided. SnowModel was created to run on grid increments of 1 to 200 m and temporal increments of 10 min to 1 day. It can also be applied using much larger grid increments, if the inherent loss in high-resolution (subgrid) information is acceptable. Simulated processes include snow accumulation; blowing-snow redistribution and sublimation; forest canopy interception, unloading, and sublimation; snow-density evolution; and snowpack melt. Conceptually, SnowModel includes the first-order physics required to simulate snow evolution within each of the global snow classes (i.e., ice, tundra, taiga, alpine/mountain, prairie, maritime, and ephemeral). The required model inputs are 1) temporally varying fields of precipitation, wind speed and direction, air temperature, and relative humidity obtained from meteorological stations and/or an atmospheric model located within or near the simulation domain; and 2) spatially distributed fields of topography and vegetation type. SnowModel’s ability to simulate seasonal snow evolution was compared against observations in both forested and nonforested landscapes. The model closely reproduced observed snow-water-equivalent distribution, time evolution, and interannual variability patterns.}},

Maps depicting relative change in phase and the theoretical relative change in SWE between satellite acquisitions are created for 3-day periods at the end of March 1994 using both ascending and descending ERS-1 overpasses. The theoretical coefficient relating relative change in phase and relative change in SWE for C-band is found to be at least twice as large as what is expected when using a simple single-layer snow model for this study area and time period. Without any direct measurements of SWE on the ground, station measurements of snow depth and hourly wind are linked to each 3-day relative change in phase map. Along with a qualitative assessment, quantitative measures of the rate and magnitude of phase change around these stations are directly compared to the hourly wind data for a given 3-day period. InSAR-derived maps acquired around a measured precipitation event show a considerable relationship to the predominant direction of strong winds over each 3-day period while maps acquired around no measureable precipitation depict much less correlation between phase change and predominant direction of strong winds. Despite limited ground measurements to infer snowpack conditions, these results show continued promise for the InSAR technique to measure changes in snowpack conditions (e.g. SWE) at much higher resolutions than manual sampling methods or passive microwave remote sensing. The extension of this technique to current L-band InSAR satellite platforms is also discussed.}},

For the most part, these models are built on similar principles. The greatest differences are found in how each model parameterizes individual processes (e.g., surface albedo and snow compaction). Parameterization choices naturally span a wide range of complexities. In this study, we evaluate the performance of different snow model parameterizations for hydrological applications using an existing multimodel energy‐balance framework and data from two well‐instrumented alpine sites with seasonal snow cover. We also include two temperature‐index snow models and an intensive, physically based multilayer snow model in our analyses. Our results show that snow mass observations provide useful information for evaluating the ability of a model to predict snowpack runoff, whereas snow depth data alone are not. For snow mass and runoff, the energy‐balance models appear transferable between our two study sites, a behavior which is not observed for snow surface temperature predictions due to site‐specificity of turbulent heat transfer formulations. Errors in the input and validation data, rather than model formulation, seem to be the greatest factor affecting model performance. The three model types provide similar ability to reproduce daily observed snowpack runoff when appropriate model structures are chosen. Model complexity was not a determinant for predicting daily snowpack mass and runoff reliably. Our study shows the usefulness of the multimodel framework for identifying appropriate models under given constraints such as data availability, properties of interest and computational cost.

This paradigm faces an impending challenge given consensus that a smaller fraction of future precipitation will fall as snow. Here, we apply downscaled hydrologic simulations from 28 climate model projections to show that by mid-century (2036–2065), 69\% of historically snowmelt-dominated areas of the western United States see a decline in the ability of snow to predict seasonal drought, increasing to 83\% by late century (2070–2099). Reduced predictability arises when peak snowpack approaches zero or because of decreased warm-season runoff efficiency. Changes in drought prediction skill show significant (P < 0.01) elevation dependence, with lower-elevation coastal areas most impacted by warming. Ancillary predictive information can only partially mitigate snow-based predictability losses to 65\% of areas, underscoring the importance of declining future snowpack. Climate warming causes less mountain precipitation to fall as snow. Hydrologic simulations predict that in a high-end emissions scenario, this decreases the predictability of seasonal water resources across the western United States, with low-elevation coastal areas impacted most strongly.}},

SNOWPACK uses measured snow depths to determine snow precipitation rates via the calculated settling rates. This requires a rigid data control algorithm. A new statistical model is used to estimate fresh snow density as a function of the measured atmospheric conditions. A statistical model is also derived for the snow albedo, which is necessary to determine the absorbed radiation. The surface sensible and latent heat flux parameterizations are derived from Monin–Obukhov similarity and include a formulation for wind pumping. The formulations will also adapt to drifting snow conditions. The new suggestion is consistent with the observation of different roughness lengths for scalars and momentum over snow. An accurate formulation, especially for the latent heat exchange, is crucial because latent heat exchange determines the formation of surface hoar, a very important weak layer. We also account for the effect of wind pumping on the thermal conductivity in the uppermost snow layers. The surface energy and mass exchange formulations are evaluated by looking at the formation of the important thin layers surface hoar and melt–freeze crusts in SNOWPACK. Those layers are well simulated. In addition, the complete snow profile development is modeled successfully for the parameters grain type, temperature, density, grain size and liquid water content. An overall score between 0 and 1 is used to describe the profile agreement with observations and an average score of over 0.8 is reached.}},

Numerous studies point to the threat global warming poses to the timing and magnitude of snow accumulation and melt. But analyses focused on snow supply do not show where changes to snowmelt runoff are likely to present the most pressing adaptation challenges, given sub-annual patterns of human water consumption and water availability from rainfall. We identify the NH basins where present spring and summer snowmelt has the greatest potential to supply the human water demand that would otherwise be unmet by instantaneous rainfall runoff. Using a multi-model ensemble of climate change projections, we find that these basins—which together have a present population of \textbackslashtextasciitilde2 billion people—are exposed to a 67\% risk of decreased snow supply this coming century. Further, in the multi-model mean, 68 basins (with a present population of >300 million people) transition from having sufficient rainfall runoff to meet all present human water demand to having insufficient rainfall runoff. However, internal climate variability creates irreducible uncertainty in the projected future trends in snow resource potential, with about 90\% of snow-sensitive basins showing potential for either increases or decreases over the near-term decades. Our results emphasize the importance of snow for fulfilling human water demand in many NH basins, and highlight the need to account for the full range of internal climate variability in developing robust climate risk management decisions.}},

We evaluate a suite of 230,000 model realizations at the snow monitoring station Kühtai (Tyrol, Austria, 1,920 m above sea level) against snow water equivalent observations. The results show throughout the course of 25 winter seasons (1991–2015) and different model performance criteria a large influence of forcing data uncertainty and its interactions on the model performance. Mean interannual total sensitivity indices are in the general order of parameter choice < model structure < forcing error, with precipitation, air temperature, and the radiative forcings controlling the variance during the accumulation period and air temperature and longwave irradiance controlling the variance during the ablation period, respectively. Model skill is highly sensitive to the snowpack liquid water transport scheme throughout the whole winter period and to albedo representation during the ablation period. We found a sufficiently long evaluation period (>10 years) is required for robust averaging. A considerable interaction effect was revealed, indicating that an improvement in the knowledge (i.e., reduction of uncertainty) of one factor alone might not necessarily improve model results. Snow models are most sensitive to input data errors then to model structure and last to model parameters Sensitivity analyses of complex snow models must include interaction effects for a representative assessment Sensitivities are variable between winter seasons, and a long period needs to be evaluated for robust averages}},

Despite its importance, global SWE measurements that are accurate, consistent, and at sufficiently high spatiotemporal resolutions are not currently available. L-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques have been used to measure SWE at local to regional scales, and two upcoming L-band SAR satellite missions have renewed interest in these techniques to provide regular SWE measurements at the global scale. However, previous research demonstrating the capabilities of L-band InSAR-SWE measurement has been limited to mountain or tundra snowpack regimes. Here we examine the feasibility of applying the same techniques over a prairie snowpack, which are typically characterized by shallow snow depths (mean snow depth of 0.22 m in this study), exposed agricultural vegetation, and high spatial variability over short distances. Our study area in central Montana, USA (47.060, -109.951) was a validation site for NASA SnowEx 2021, as part of the UAVSAR snow timeseries. Airborne L-band SAR imagery was acquired by the UAVSAR platform while concurrent snow measurements were collected using uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-based LiDAR, UAV-based photogrammetry, and ground-based manual techniques. This validation dataset enables an investigation of the effects of sub-pixel snow cover heterogeneity and exposed agricultural vegetation stubble on SAR data and the resulting SWE estimations. Results based on repeated application of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test show that UAVSAR VV phase change is sensitive to differences in snow cover but relatively unaffected by differences in agricultural stubble height. However, we did not find similarly definitive results when we used the same phase change data to estimate SWE. Although broad spatial patterns were similar in both LiDAR-derived and InSAR-derived SWE estimates, considerable differences in the two estimates were apparent in areas with large sub-pixel snow depth variability. Our results indicate that additional work is necessary to derive accurate SWE estimates in prairie environments. Regular measurements from L-band SAR satellites will provide an excellent opportunity to refine InSAR-based snow estimation techniques over shallow, heterogeneous snowpacks.}},

During a week in August 2011 we located repeating infrasound events, peaked in energy between 1 and 10Hz, originating from at least five independent geothermal features, including the episodically erupting Great Fountain, Fountain and Kaleidoscope Geysers, as well as periodic infrasound from nearby Botryoidal and persistent sound from Firehole Spring. Although activity from nearby cone-type geysers was not detected in the infrasound band up through 50Hz, the major fountain-type geysers (i.e., with columns greater than 10m) could be detected at several kilometers, and two minor geysers (i.e., a few meters in eruption height) could be tracked at distances up to a few hundred meters. Detection of geyser activity was especially comprehensive at night when ambient noise was low. We conclude that infrasound monitoring of fountain-type geysers permits convenient tracking of geyser activity, episodicity, signal duration, energy content, and spectral content. These parameters enable objective statistical quantification of geyser behavior and changes over time that may be due to external forcing.

The energy balance of the heated pavement system is described and the effective thermal conductivity of the melting snow layer during the melting process of snow on a heated pavement system is calculated based on the volume fractions and thermal conductivity of ice, water and air. The results show that the thermal conductivity of an uncompressed and compressed melting snow layer on a heated pavement can be best described as a combination of a parallel and series system.

abstract = {{Snow distribution patterns are similar from one year to the next because they are largely controlled by the interaction of topography, vegetation, and consistent synoptic weather patterns. On a yearly basis none of these controls changes radically. As a consequence, deep and shallow areas of snow tend to be fixed in space, producing depth differences that may vary in absolute, but not relative, amounts from year to year. While this fact is widely known, the use of patterns in modeling snow cover distribution is limited. Here, on the basis of a training set of nine annual snow depth surveys from a small tundra basin in Alaska, we identify the climatological snow distribution pattern (CSDP). Using this and a few depth measurements, the snow distribution for years that were not included in the training set is predicted and mapped with a near-zero bias and RMSE that ranged from 4.4 to 10.4 cm. The accuracy of this strictly empirical approach to modeling the depth distribution is similar to, or better than, the output from a weather-driven physically based snow model. However, in our view a hybrid approach is best. Ingesting the CSDP into SnowModel, a widely used numerical code that simulates snow processes, the accuracy of the model output is improved by up to 60\%. This hybrid approach retains the advantages of running a weather-driven numerical code but adds spatial accuracy currently only obtainable from observed snow patterns. The patterns can be captured in several ways, including aerial photography or satellite remote sensing during snowmelt.}},

A single model that combines existing parameterizations of differing complexity in many different configurations to generate large ensembles of simulations is presented here. The model is driven and evaluated with data from four winters at an alpine site in France. Consideration of errors in simulations of snow mass, snow depth, albedo and surface temperature show that there is no “best” model, but there is a group of model configurations that give consistently good results, another group that give consistently poor results, and many configurations that give good results in some cases and poor results in others. There is no clear link between model complexity and performance, but the most consistent results come from configurations that have prognostic representations of snow density and albedo and that take some account of storage and refreezing of liquid water within the snow.}},

With ongoing climate change, the frequency and types of snow avalanches may change, affecting the rates of avalanche burial and survival. With a wetter and warmer snow climate, consequences of burial may become more severe. In this review, we assess the potential effects of climate change on the frequency and characteristics of avalanches. We then discuss how these changes might affect the survival rates of subjects buried by avalanches and might influence the responses of search and rescue (SAR) teams and health care providers. While climate change is inevitable, the effects on avalanches remain elusive. The frequency of human triggered avalanches may not change, because this depends largely on the number and behavior of winter recreationists. Blunt trauma and secondary injuries will likely become more frequent as terrain roughness is expected to rise and snow cover to become thinner. Higher snow densities in avalanche debris will likely interfere with the respiration of completely buried victims. Asphyxia and trauma, as causes of avalanche death, may increase. It is unlikely that SAR and health care providers involved in avalanche rescue will have to change their strategies in areas where they are already established. The effects of climate change might foster the expansion of mitigation strategies and the establishment of mountain rescue services in areas subject to increased avalanche hazards caused by changes in snow cover and land use.}},

It is shown that both conventional and dense-medium radiative transfer models fail to adequately explain the observed results. A direct polarimetric inversion approach is described by which the characteristics of the snow medium are extracted from the measured data. The second type of experiment examined in this study involves diurnal backscatter measurements that were made contemporaneously with detailed measurements of the snow-wetness depth profiles of the observed scene.

Using standard array processing techniques, we compared the infrasound source back azimuths with the avalanche flow path identified by frame‐differenced, geo‐referenced video. Results show that infrasound records begin with direct arrivals followed by echoes from the avalanche‐triggering explosions and these decay within 35 s of the detonations. Subsequent infrasound, which lasts 20–30 s, could then be attributed exclusively to the avalanche. These infrasound detections, and their triangulated source locations, progress downhill over time and the most intense infrasound appears to originate from a steep, mid‐path cliff band, where the avalanche reached speeds in excess of 30 m/s and accelerations of more than 5 m/s2. The recorded infrasound was compared to two candidate source models extracted from video: total flow motion and advancing flow motion. Advancing source locations were compared to acoustic intensity time series using a nonnegative least squares inversion to solve for, and to quantify, time‐varying infrasound source intensity. We observed that certain portions of the flow, most notably the early stages and the end stages (when the powder cloud was expanding and settling) were infrasonically quiet. Rapid gravity‐driven flows, such as mud flows, debris flows, and snow avalanches, produce intense infrasound that may be recorded at distances of many kilometers. Infrasound is low‐frequency sounds that are inaudible, but travel long distances efficiently and can be recorded using specialized microphones. This study uses eight microphones distributed around a snow avalanche path to map how the avalanche advances and to quantify which part of the snow avalanche produces the majority of the infrasound. We use a video record of the featured avalanche to confirm findings and determine that much of the sound is created as the avalanche accelerates over a steep cliff band. Lessons learned here can be used to better monitor snow avalanche activity elsewhere including highways that are threatened by avalanches following snowstorms.

The coupled effect of major events and natural phenomena sometimes leads to misinterpretation of interferometric coherence maps and often degrades the performance of change detection algorithms. To differentiate decorrelation sources caused by natural changes from those caused by an event of interest, we formulated a temporal decorrelation model that accounts for the random motion of canopy elements, temporally correlated dielectric changes, and temporally uncorrelated dielectric changes of canopy and ground. The model parameters are extracted from the interferometric pairs associated with natural changes in canopy and ground using the proposed temporal decorrelation model. In addition, the cumulative distribution functions of the temporally uncorrelated model parameters, which are associated with natural changes in canopy and ground, are estimated from interferometric pairs acquired before the event. Model parameters are also extracted from interferometric SAR data acquired across the event and compared with the cumulative probabilities of natural changes in order to calculate the probability of a major event. Subsequently, pixels with cumulative probabilities greater than 75\% are marked as changed due to the event. A case study for detecting volcanic ash during the eruption of the Shinmoedake volcano in January 2011 was carried out using L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite PALSAR data.}},

The brightness temperature was measured at horizontal and vertical polarization, the backscattering coefficient at HH, VV, HV, and VH polarization, all at incidence angles from 0° to 70°. In addition, we measured soil parameters such as moisture, roughness, and texture. The results are subdivided into three sections. First the microwave parameters measured during two diurnal freeze — thaw cycles of the soil are shown. For thawing the soil has three layers wet/frozen/wet and therefore different microwave properties than for freezing. Second frozen soil (thickness of the frozen layer is larger than the penetration depth of the radiation) is compared with unfrozen soil. For the horizontal polarization we separate the reflectivity into the Fresnel reflectivity and a roughness factor. The active data are compared with the geometrical-optics model at the higher frequencies and with the small-perturbation model at the lower frequencies. In addition the data are used to determine the sensitivity of the microwave parameters to soil liquid water content. Third the growth of a frozen soil layer is monitored. These data are used to test layered media models. Due to the scale height of surface roughness, which is of the order of the penetration depth of the radiation, the models do not agree well with the measurements.

Snow surface melt/freeze cycles, associated with diurnal fluctuations in radiative inputs, are hallmarks of this transition. C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) reliably detects meltwater in the snowpack. Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band SAR offers consistent acquisition patterns that allow for diurnal investigations of melting snow. We used over 50 snow pit observations from 2020 in Grand Mesa, Colorado, USA, to track temperature and wetness in the snowpack as a function of depth and time during snowpack phases of warming, ripening, and runoff. We also ran the physically-based SnowModel, which provided a spatially and temporally continuous independent indication of snowpack conditions. Snowpack phases were identified and corroborated by comparing field measurements with SnowModel outputs. Knowledge of snowpack warming, ripening, and runoff phases was used to interpret diurnal changes in S1 backscatter values. Both field measurements and SnowModel simulations suggested that S1 SAR was not sensitive to the initial snowpack warming phase on Grand Mesa. In the ripening and runoff phases, the diurnal cycle in S1 SAR co-polarized backscatter was affected by both surface melt/freeze as well as the conditions of the snowpack underneath (ripening or ripe). The ripening phase was associated with significant increases in morning backscatter values, likely due to volume scattering from surface melt/freeze crusts, as well as significant decreases in evening backscatter values associated with snowmelt. During the runoff phase, both morning and evening backscatter decreased compared to reference values. These unique S1 diurnal signatures, and their interpretations using field measurements and SnowModel outputs, highlight the capacities and limitations of S1 SAR to understand snow surface states and bulk phases, which may offer runoff forecasting or energy balance model validation or parameterization, especially useful in remote or sparsely-gauged alpine basins.}},

The RKT is a robust, nonparametric test that provides an increased power of trend detection by grouping data from multiple sites within a given geographic region. The RKT analyses indicated strong, pervasive trends in snowmelt and streamflow timing, which have shifted toward earlier in the year by a median of 2–3 weeks over the 29-yr study period. In contrast, relatively few statistically significant trends were detected using simple linear regression. RKT analyses also indicated that November–May air temperatures increased by a median of 0.9°C decade−1, while 1 April SWE and maximum SWE declined by a median of 4.1 and 3.6 cm decade−1, respectively. Multiple linear regression models were created, using monthly air temperatures, snowfall, latitude, and elevation as explanatory variables to identify major controlling factors on snowmelt timing. The models accounted for 45\% of the variance in snowmelt onset, and 78\% of the variance in the snowmelt center of mass (when half the snowpack had melted). Variations in springtime air temperature and SWE explained most of the interannual variability in snowmelt timing. Regression coefficients for air temperature were negative, indicating that warm temperatures promote early melt. Regression coefficients for SWE, latitude, and elevation were positive, indicating that abundant snowfall tends to delay snowmelt, and snowmelt tends to occur later at northern latitudes and high elevations. Results from this study indicate that even the mountains of Colorado, with their high elevations and cold snowpacks, are experiencing substantial shifts in the timing of snowmelt and snowmelt runoff toward earlier in the year.}},

For dry snow of a few meters depth and frequencies below 20GHz, absorption and scattering in the snow volume are negligible compared with the backscattered energy from the underlying ground.

abstract = {{Seasonal snow cover is the largest single component of the cryosphere in areal extent, covering an average of 46 million square km of Earth's surface (31 \% of the land area) each year, and is thus an important expression of and driver of the Earth’s climate. In recent years, Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has been declining at about the same rate (\textbackslashtextasciitilde −13 \%/decade) as Arctic summer sea ice. More than one-sixth of the world’s population relies on seasonal snowpack and glaciers for a water supply that is likely to decrease this century. Snow is also a critical component of Earth’s cold regions' ecosystems, in which wildlife, vegetation, and snow are strongly interconnected. Snow water equivalent (SWE) describes the quantity of snow stored on the land surface and is of fundamental importance to water, energy, and geochemical cycles. Quality global SWE estimates are lacking. Given the vast seasonal extent combined with the spatially variable nature of snow distribution at regional and local scales, surface observations will not be able to provide sufficient SWE information. Satellite observations presently cannot provide SWE information at the spatial and temporal resolutions required to address science and high socio-economic value applications such as water resource management and streamflow forecasting. In this paper, we review the potential contribution of X- and Ku-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for global monitoring of SWE. We describe radar interactions with snow-covered landscapes, characterization of snowpack properties using radar measurements, and refinement of retrieval algorithms via synergy with other microwave remote sensing approaches. SAR can image the surface during both day and night regardless of cloud cover, allowing high-frequency revisit at high spatial resolution as demonstrated by missions such as Sentinel-1. The physical basis for estimating SWE from X- and Ku-band radar measurements at local scales is volume scattering by millimetre-scale snow grains. Inference of global snow properties from SAR requires an interdisciplinary approach based on field observations of snow microstructure, physical snow modelling, electromagnetic theory, and retrieval strategies over a range of scales. New field measurement capabilities have enabled significant advances in understanding snow microstructure such as grain size, densities, and layering. We describe radar interactions with snow-covered landscapes, the characterization of snowpack properties using radar measurements, and the refinement of retrieval algorithms via synergy with other microwave remote sensing approaches. This review serves to inform the broader snow research, monitoring, and applications communities on progress made in recent decades, and sets the stage for a new era in SWE remote-sensing from SAR measurements.}},

In this application, a theoretical method of snow depth estimation with repeat-pass InSAR measurements was proposed, and a preliminary sensitivity analysis of snow phase changes versus the incident angle and snow density was developed. Moreover, the snow density and incident angle parameters were analyzed and calibrated, and the local incident angle was used as a substitute for the satellite incident angle to improve the snow depth estimation. From the results, the coherence images showed that a high degree of coherence can be found for dry snow, and, apart from the effect of snow, land use/cover change due to a long temporal baseline and geometric distortion due to the rugged terrain were the main constraints for InSAR technique to measure snow depth and SWE in this area. The result of snow depth estimation between July 2008 and February 2009 demonstrated that the average snow depth was about 20 cm, which was consistent with the field survey results. The areal coverage of snow distribution estimated from the snow depth and SWE results was consistent with snow cover obtained from HJ-1A CCD optical data at the same time.}},

To date, however, observations of changing SWE or snowmelt have been limited to the state of Colorado in the intermountain west (IMW), defined here as the Rio Grande, Colorado River, and Great Basins, which supply water to the driest regions of North America. We used daily SNOTEL data collected between 1984 and 2009 combined with the nonparametric regional Kendall test to demonstrate significant and widespread changes in the duration of snow cover in these river basins. Daily SNOTEL data demonstrated that basin average maximum SWE occurred as early as 7 March (Lower Colorado River Basin) and as late as 13 April (Upper Colorado, Yampa, and White River Basins). Although significant increases in winter temperature (T) were widespread, there were minimal changes in the day of maximum accumulation and no indications from SWE to winter precipitation ratios (SWE:P) and winter T observations that a transition from snow to rain had occurred. While there was little change in day of maximum accumulation, the duration of snow cover decreased in 11 of 13 drainage regions, and snowmelt center of mass (SM50) advanced 1 to 4 days per decade in 6 of 13 regions. There were significant trends toward a faster SM50 and shorter duration of snow cover in the highest-elevation regions (>2800 m) of the Colorado River Basin, suggesting that winter T and P may not be the primary driver of change. Our results show that the IMW hydroclimate is both spatially and temporally variable, with few changes in winter T and P in the Great Basin and drier and warmer winters in the Colorado River and Rio Grande Basins. The changes in snowmelt timing also were variable, with a shorter SM50 and less maximum SWE in the Colorado River and Rio Grande Basins. The variable response of snowpacks in the IMW to widespread warming highlights the need for additional research into the mass and energy balance of these continental snowpacks.}},

The most important polarimetric distortions in airborne PolSAR data sets are the channel imbalance and crosstalk. The minimization of these polarimetric distortions using polarimetric calibration techniques is very important to carry out the quantitative analysis using PolSAR data and time series analysis and to compare results between different sensors. In the current state of the art, the spatial variability of the polarimetric distortions at different slant‐range positions in the data set was not completely analyzed and also the temporal variability of the polarimetric distortions using multiple data sets needs to be more investigated. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to develop an operational processor to perform the external polarimetric calibration of the L‐band Uninhibited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar system and to analyze the spatio‐temporal behavior of the polarimetric distortions. The polarimetric distortion matrix (PDM) was formulated after considering the crosstalk and channel imbalance polarimetric distortions to derive the scattering matrix free from all kinds of polarimetric distortions from the observed scattering matrix. The Quegan, improved Quegan, and Ainsworth methods for polarimetric calibration were implemented to solve the PDM. The residual channel imbalance and crosstalk after polarimetric calibration were estimated to compare the calibration efficiency of these methods. After that, a spatio‐temporal analysis was carried out with several data sets to assess the spatio‐temporal behavior of these polarimetric distortions. The polarimetric signatures and the coherency matrix behavior of the trihedral corner reflectors were used to analyze the ground target characterization improvement after polarimetric calibration. The results obtained from this study revealed that the crosstalk is the major cause for the polarimetric distortions and the channel imbalance and phase bias present in the data sets were not high. From the spatio‐temporal analysis, it was found that the variability of these polarimetric distortions both in spatial and temporal domains was minimum and can be discarded without causing any considerable error in the polarimetric calibration process.

Various algorithms including the Environment Canada (EC) algorithms, the spectral polarization difference (SPD) algorithm, and an artificial neural network (ANN) for both SSM/I and AMSR-E are evaluated against in situ SWE observations using several statistical metrics. The results show that the EC algorithms developed specifically for the southern prairies and boreal forest perform poorly across the complex topography and generally deep snow of the QRB. For other frequency combinations of SSM/I and AMSR-E measurements, significant relationships between TB difference and in situ SWE exist only when the snow accumulation is less than a threshold of 250 or 400 mm, which varies at the different in situ stations. Overall, AMSR-E provides better estimates of retrieved SWE than SSM/I. Compared to the algorithms based on TB difference, the ANNs for SSM/I and AMSR-E perform much better. The ANNs trained with all channels of AMSR-E have the best performance in fitting SWE and are able to resolve the temporal variations of SWE at all in situ stations. However, due to the complexity of the topography and vegetation in this mountainous watershed, the ANNs based only on limited in situ stations are not able to retrieve the spatial variations of SWE in this area.}},

The effect of varying the texture, bulk density, temperature, and soluble salt content on this relationship was also determined.

The water or salt solution was cycled continuously to or from the specimen, with minimal disturbance, through porous disks placed along the sides of the coaxial tube. Four mineral soils with a range of texture from sandy loam to clay were tested. An empirical relationship between the apparent dielectric constant Ka and the volumetric water content θv, which is independent of soil type, soil density, soil temperature, and soluble salt content, can be used to determine θv, from air dry to water saturated, with an error of estimate of 0.013. Precision of θv to within ±0.01 from Ka can be obtained with a calibration for the particular granular material of interest. An organic soil, vermiculite, and two sizes of glass beads were also tested successfully. The empirical relationship determined here agrees very well with other experimenters' results, which use a wide range of electrical techniques over the frequency range of 20 MHz and 1 GHz and widely varying soil types. The results of applying the TDR technique on parallel transmission lines in the field to measure θv versus depth are encouraging.}},

abstract = {{Detailed information on the spatiotemporal snow depth distribution is a crucial input for numerous applications in hydrology, climatology, ecology and avalanche research. Today, snow depth distribution is usually estimated by combining point measurements from weather stations or observers in the field with spatial interpolation algorithms. However, even a dense measurement network like the one in Switzerland, with more than one measurement station per 10 km2 on average, is not able to capture the large spatial variability of snow depth present in alpine terrain. Remote sensing methods, such as laser scanning or digital photogrammetry, have recently been successfully applied to map snow depth variability at local and regional scales. However, in most countries such data acquisition is costly if manned airplanes are involved. The effectiveness of ground-based measurements on the other hand is often hindered by occlusions, due to the complex terrain or acute viewing angles. In this paper, we investigate the application of unmanned aerial systems (UASs), in combination with structure-from-motion photogrammetry, to map snow depth distribution. Compared to manual measurements, such systems are relatively cost-effective and can be applied very flexibly to cover terrain not accessible from the ground. In this study, we map snow depth at two different locations: (a) a sheltered location at the bottom of the Flüela valley (1900 m a.s.l.) and (b) an exposed location on a peak (2500 m a.s.l.) in the ski resort Jakobshorn, both in the vicinity of Davos, Switzerland. At the first test site, we monitor the ablation on three different dates. We validate the photogrammetric snow depth maps using simultaneously acquired manual snow depth measurements. The resulting snow depth values have a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 0.07 to 0.15 m on meadows and rocks and a RMSE of less than 0.30 m on sections covered by bushes or tall grass, compared to manual probe measurements. This new measurement technology opens the door for efficient, flexible, repeatable and cost-effective snow depth monitoring over areas of several hectares for various applications, if the national and regional regulations permit the application of UASs.}},

This novel approach is tested using a simple snow model for an alpine basin located in Trentino Alto Adige, Italy. We quantify the precipitation biases across the basin and found that the assimilation method (i) corrects for snowfall biases and uncertainties, (ii) leads to cumulative snowfall elevation patterns that are consistent across precipitation products, and (iii) results in overall improved basin-wide snow variables (snow depth and snow cover area) and basin streamflow estimates.}},

However, atmospheric artifacts due to spatial and temporal variations of the atmospheric state often affect the reliability and accuracy of its results. The commonly-known Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS) appears in the interferograms as ghost fringes not related to either topography or deformation. Atmospheric artifact mitigation remains one of the biggest challenges to be addressed within the DInSAR community. State-of-the-art research works have revealed that atmospheric artifacts can be partially compensated with empirical models, point-wise GPS zenith path delay, and numerical weather prediction models. In this study, we implement an accurate and realistic computing strategy using atmospheric reanalysis ERA5 data to estimate atmospheric artifacts. With this approach, the Line-of-Sight (LOS) path along the satellite trajectory and the monitored points is considered, rather than estimating it from the zenith path delay. Compared with the zenith delay-based method, the key advantage is that it can avoid errors caused by any anisotropic atmospheric phenomena. The accurate method is validated with Sentinel-1 data in three different test sites: Tenerife island (Spain), Almería (Spain), and Crete island (Greece). The effectiveness and performance of the method to remove APS from interferograms is evaluated in the three test sites showing a great improvement with respect to the zenith-based approach.}},

abstract = {{The main objective of this study was to monitor wet snow conditions from Sentinel-1 over a season, to examine its variation over time by cross-checking wet snow with independent snow and weather estimates, and to study its distribution taking into account terrain characteristics such as elevation, orientation, and slope. One of our motivations was to derive useful representations of daily or seasonal snow changes that would help to easily identify wet snow elevations and determine melt-out days in an area of interest. In this work, a well-known approach in the literature is used to estimate the extent of wet snow cover continuously over a season and an analysis of the influence of complex mountain topography on snow distribution is proposed taking into account altitude, slope, and aspect of the terrain. The Sentinel-1 wet snow extent product was compared with Sentinel-2 snow products for cloud free scenes. We show that while there are good agreements between the two satellite products, differences exist, especially in areas of forests and glaciers where snow is underestimated. This underestimation must be considered alongside the areas of geometric distortion that were excluded from our study. We analysed retrievals at the scale of our study area by examining wet snow Altitude–Orientation diagrams for different classes of slopes and also wet snow Altitude–Time diagrams for different classes of orientations. We have shown that this type of representation is very useful to get an overview of the snow distribution as it allows to identify very easily wet snow lines for different orientations. For an orientation of interest, the Altitude–Time diagrams can be used to track the evolution of snow to locate altitudes and dates of snow loss. We also show that ascending/descending Sentinel-1 image time series are complementary to monitor wet snow over the French alpine areas to highlight wet snow altitude ranges and identify melt-out days. Links have also been made between Sentinel-1 responses (wet snow) and snow/meteorological events carefully listed over the entire 2017–2018 season.}},

A novel in situmulti‐sensor measurement system providing high‐resolution observation of gas transport in snow is demonstrated. Carbon monoxide was selected as the tracer gas for having essentially the same density as air, low background concentration, low water solubility, and for being detectable to ≤ 1 ppmv with small, low‐cost, low‐power sensors. The plume of 1\% CO injections 30 cm below the snow surface was monitored using 28 sensors (4 locations, 7 depths). The CO breakthrough curves obtained at distances of 0.5–1 m were in good agreement with a simple analytical advection‐diffusion model. The tracer system appears suitable for a wide range of applications in experimental soil science and hydrology addressing moisture transport and evapotranspiration processes.

The critical role of snow in water supply has been frequently quantified using the ratio of snowmelt‐derived runoff to total runoff. However, current estimates of the fraction of annual runoff generated by snowmelt are not based on systematic analyses. Here based on hydrological model simulations and a new snowmelt tracking algorithm, we show that 53\% of the total runoff in the western United States originates as snowmelt, despite only 37\% of the precipitation falling as snow. In mountainous areas, snowmelt is responsible for 70\% of the total runoff. By 2100, the contribution of snowmelt to runoff will decrease by one third for the western U.S. in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. Snowmelt‐derived runoff currently makes up two thirds of the inflow to the region's major reservoirs. We argue that substantial impacts on water supply are likely in a warmer climate.

Snow accumulation and melt vary over a broad range of spatial scales, preventing accurate extrapolation of sparse in situ observations to watershed scales. The lidar onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation, Satellite (ICESat-2) was designed for precise mapping of ice sheets and sea ice, and here we assess the feasibility of snow depth-mapping using ICESat-2 data in more complex and rugged mountain landscapes. We explore the utility of ATL08 Land and Vegetation Height and ATL06 Land Ice Height differencing from reference elevation datasets in two end member study sites. We analyze ∼3 years of data for Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed in Idaho's Owyhee Mountains and Wolverine Glacier in southcentral Alaska's Kenai Mountains. Our analysis reveals decimeter-scale uncertainties in derived snow depth and glacier mass balance at the watershed scale. Both accuracy and precision decrease as slope increases: the magnitudes of the median and median of the absolute deviation of elevation errors (MAD) vary from ∼0.2 m for slopes <5° to >1 m for slopes >20°. For glacierized regions, failure to account for intra- and inter-annual evolution of glacier surface elevations can strongly bias ATL06 elevations, resulting in under-estimation of the mass balance gradient with elevation. Based on these results, we conclude that ATL08 and ATL06 observations are best suited for characterization of watershed-scale snow depth and mass balance gradients over relatively shallow slopes with thick snowpacks. In these regions, ICESat-2 elevation residual-derived snow depth and mass balance transects can provide valuable watershed scale constraints on terrain parameter- and model-derived estimates of snow accumulation and melt.}},

This controlled study at the Harry W. Morrison Dam (HWMD) on the Boise River, Idaho, explores how temporal variation in fluvial systems affects surrounding acoustic and seismic fields. Adjusting the configuration of the HWMD changed the river bathymetry and therefore the form of the standing wave below the dam. The HWMD was adjusted to generate four distinct wave regimes that were parameterized through their dimensionless Froude numbers (Fr) and observations of the ambient seismic and acoustic wavefields at the study site. To generate detectable and coherent signals, a standing wave must exceed a threshold Fr value of 1.7, where a nonbreaking undular jump turns into a breaking weak hydraulic jump. Hydrodynamic processes may partially control the spectral content of the seismic and acoustic energies. Furthermore, spectra related to reproducible wave conditions can be used to calibrate and verify fluvial seismic and acoustic models. For detectable and coherent seismoacoustic energies to be generated, a standing wave must exceed a threshold Fr value of approximately 1.7 Hydrodynamic processes may partially control the spectral content of the seismic and acoustic energies Variations in the width and amplitude of seismoacoustic spectral peaks may be explained by horizontal variations across a hydraulic jump}},

abstract = {{We report on a unique set of infrasound observations from a single earthquake, the 2011 January 3 Circleville earthquake (Mw 4.7, depth of 8 km), which was recorded by nine infrasound arrays in Utah. Based on an analysis of the signal arrival times and backazimuths at each array, we find that the infrasound arrivals at six arrays can be associated to the same source and that the source location is consistent with the earthquake epicentre. Results of propagation modelling indicate that the lack of associated arrivals at the remaining three arrays is due to path effects. Based on these findings we form the working hypothesis that the infrasound is generated by body waves causing the epicentral region to pump the atmosphere, akin to a baffled piston. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a numerical seismoacoustic model to simulate the generation of epicentral infrasound from earthquakes. We model the generation of seismic waves using a 3‐D finite difference algorithm that accounts for the earthquake moment tensor, source time function, depth and local geology. The resultant acceleration–time histories on a 2‐D grid at the surface then provide the initial conditions for modelling the near‐field infrasonic pressure wave using the Rayleigh integral. Finally, we propagate the near‐field source pressure through the Ground‐to‐Space atmospheric model using a time‐domain Parabolic Equation technique. By comparing the resultant predictions with the six epicentral infrasound observations from the 2011 January 3, Circleville earthquake, we show that the observations agree well with our predictions. The predicted and observed amplitudes are within a factor of 2 (on average, the synthetic amplitudes are a factor of 1.6 larger than the observed amplitudes). In addition, arrivals are predicted at all six arrays where signals are observed, and importantly not predicted at the remaining three arrays. Durations are typically predicted to within a factor of 2, and in some cases much better. These results suggest that measured infrasound from the Circleville earthquake is consistent with the generation of infrasound from body waves in the epicentral region.}},

In Alaska, we use airborne altimetry from 116 glaciers to estimate a regional mass balance of −75 ± 11 Gt yr−1 (1994–2013). Our glacier sample is spatially well distributed, yet pervasive variability in mass balances obscures geospatial and climatic relationships. However, for the first time, these data allow the partitioning of regional mass balance by glacier type. We find that tidewater glaciers are losing mass at substantially slower rates than other glaciers in Alaska and collectively contribute to only 6\% of the regional mass loss.

At this horizontal resolution, the spatiotemporal distribution of the orographic snowfall and snowpack is well captured partly due to the ability of the model to realistically simulate mesoscale and microphysical features such as orographically induced updrafts driving clouds and precipitation. The historical simulation well captures the observed snowfall and snowpack amounts and pattern in the western U.S. The future climate simulation uses the Pseudo-Global Warming approach, taking the climate change signal from CMIP5 multi-model ensemble-mean difference between 2070–2099 and 1976–2005. The results show that the thermodynamic impacts of climate change in the western U.S. can be characterized considering mountain ranges in two distinct geographic regions: the mountain ranges close to the Pacific Ocean (coastal ranges) and those in the inter-mountain west. Climate change out to 2100 significantly impacts all aspects of the water cycle, with pronounced climate change response in the coastal ranges. A notable result is that the snowpack in the Pacific Northwest is predicted to decrease by \textbackslashtextasciitilde 70\% by 2100. Trends of this magnitude have already been observed in the historical data and in previous studies. The current Pseudo Global Warming future climate simulation and previous global climate simulations all suggest that these trends will continue to the point that most snowpack will be gone by 2100 in the Pacific Northwest for the most aggressive RCP8.5 climate scenario, even if annual precipitation increases by 10\%. Future work will focus on extending the current convective permitting results to a full climate change simulation allowing for dynamical changes in the flow.}},

Past evaluations of snow mapping accuracy typically relied on satellite data collected at a higher spatial resolution than the data in question. However, these optical data cannot characterize snow cover mapping performance under forest canopies or at the meter scale. Here, we use 3 m spatial resolution snow depth maps collected on 116 d by an aerial laser scanner to validate band ratio and spectral-mixture snow cover mapping algorithms. Such a comprehensive evaluation of sub-canopy snow mapping performance has not been undertaken previously. The following standard (produced operationally by an agency) products are evaluated: NASA gap-filled Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD10A1F, NASA gap-filled Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) VNP10A1F, and United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat 8 Level-3 Fractional Snow Covered Area. Two spectral-unmixing approaches are also evaluated: Snow-Covered Area and Grain Size (SCAG) and Snow Property Inversion from Remote Sensing (SPIReS), both of which are gap-filled MODIS products and are also run on Landsat 8. We assess subpixel snow mapping performance while considering the fractional snow-covered area (fSCA), canopy cover, sensor zenith angle, and other variables within six global seasonal snow classes. Metrics are calculated at the pixel and basin scales, including the root-mean-square error (RMSE), bias, and F statistic (a detection measure). The newer MOD10A1F Version 61 and VNP10A1F Version 1 product biases (- 7.1 \%, -9.5 \%) improve significantly when linear equations developed for older products are applied (2.8 \%, -2.7 \%) to convert band ratios to fSCA. The F statistics are unchanged (94.4 \%, 93.1 \%) and the VNP10A1F RMSE improves (18.6 \% to 15.7 \%), while the MOD10A1F RMSE worsens (12.7 \% to 13.7 \%). Consistent with previous studies, spectral-unmixing approaches (SCAG, SPIReS) show lower biases (-0.1 \%, -0.1 \%) and RMSE (12.1 \%, 12.0 \%), with higher F statistics (95.6 \%, 96.1 \%) relative to the band ratio approaches for MODIS.

The filtering performance of Goldstein and its improved filters is mostly affected by several parameters, such as the noise suppression parameter α, the sliding patch size, and the kernel window size. Yet, the fixed parameters will cause the filtering intensity to mismatch the noise levels of different regions. In this paper, we propose an adaptive patch-based Goldstein filter (AP-Goldstein filter), which takes the pseudo-variation coefficient as the measure of patch homogeneity and adaptively selects the patch sizes in different regions of interferogram. This filter controls the noise suppression parameter α by pseudo-coherence, which is a common and effective indicator applied to filter the interferogram phase. Meanwhile, the previously determined patch size of each pixel is used to confirm the kernel window size at the same region. The proposed and other advanced filters were tested on real and simulated interferograms. The qualitative and quantitative comparison of the experimental results shows that this new method can better restrain the phase noise of interferogram while maintaining the edge detailed information and can improve the automation of filtering.}},

abstract = {{The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NOAA/NESDIS) Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) has undergone substantial changes since its inception in 1997. These changes include the data sources used to generate the product, methodology of product creation, and even changes in the output. Among the most notable of the past upgrades to the IMS are a 4‐km resolution grid output, ingest of an automated snow detection algorithm, expansion to a global extent, and a static Digital Elevation Model for mapping based on elevation. Further developments to this dynamic system will continue as NOAA strives to improve snow parameterization for weather forecast modeling. Several future short‐term enhancements will be evaluated for possible transition to operations before the Northern Hemisphere winter of 2006–2007. Current and historical data will be adopted to a geographic information systems (GIS) format before 2007, as well. Longer‐term enhancements are also planned to account for new snow data sources, mapping methodologies and user requirements. These modifications are being made with care to preserve the integrity of the long‐standing satellite‐derived snow record that is vital to global change detection.
